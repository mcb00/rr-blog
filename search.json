    "text": "Tree branches on a chilly day in Johnson City\nAhh, XGBoost, what an absolutely stellar implementation of gradient boosting. Once Tianqi Chen and Carlos Guestrin of the University of Washington published the XGBoost paper and shared the open source code in the mid 2010’s, the algorithm quickly gained adoption in the ML community, appearing in over half of winning Kagle submissions in 2015. Nowadays it’s certainly among the most popular gradient boosting libraries, along with LightGBM and CatBoost, although the highly scientific indicator of GitHub stars per year indicates that it is in fact the most beloved gradient boosting package of all. Since it was the first of the modern popular boosting frameworks, and since benchmarking indicates that no other boosting algorithm outperforms it, we can comfortably focus our attention on understanding XGBoost.\nThe XGBoost authors identify two key aspects of a machine learning system: (1) a flexible statistical model and (2) a scalable learning system to fit that model using data. XGBoost improves on both of these aspects, providing a more flexible and feature-rich statistical model and building a truly scalable system to fit it. In this post we’re going to focus on the statistical modeling innovations, outlining the key differences from the classic gradient boosting machine and divinginto the mathematical derivation of the XGBoost learning algorithm. If you’re not already familiar with gradient boosting, go back and read the earlier posts in the series before jumping in here.\nBuckle up, dear reader. Today we understand how XGBoost works, no hand waving required."

The final model takes the form\n\\[\\hat{y}_i = F(\\mathbf{x}_i) = b + \\eta \\sum_{k=1}^K f_k(\\mathbf{x}_i) \\]\nwhere \\(b\\) is the base prediction, \\(\\eta\\) is the learning rate hyperparameter that helps control overfitting by reducing the contributions of each booster, and each of the \\(K\\) boosters \\(f_k\\) is a decision tree. To help us connect the dots between theory and code, whenever we encounter new hyperparameters, I’ll point out their names from the XGBoost Parameter Documentation. So, \\(b\\) can be set by base_score, and \\(\\eta\\) is set by either eta or learning_rate.\nXGBoost introduces two key statistical learning improvements over the classic gradient boosting model. First, it reimagines the gradient descent algorithm used for training, and second it uses a custom-built decision tree with extra functionality as its booster.

    "text": "Descent Algorithm Innovations\n\nRegularized Objective Function\nIn the post on GBM with any loss function, we looked at loss functions of the form \\(\\sum_i l(y_i,\\hat{y}_i)\\) which compute some distance between targets \\(y_i\\) and predictions \\(\\hat{y}_i\\) and sum them up over the training dataset. XGBoost introduces regularization into the objective function so that the objective takes the form\n\\[ L = \\sum_i l(y_i,\\hat{y}_i) + \\sum_k \\Omega(f_k) \\]\nwhere \\(l\\) is some twice-differentiable loss function. \\(\\Omega\\) is a regularization that penalizes the complexity of each tree booster, taking the form\n\\[ \\Omega(f) = \\gamma T + \\frac{1}{2} \\lambda ||w||^2 \\]\nwhere \\(T\\) is the number of leaf nodes and \\(||w||^2\\) is the squared sum of the leaf prediction values. This introduces two new hyperparameters: \\(\\gamma\\) which penalizes the number of leaf nodes and \\(\\lambda\\) which is the L-2 regularization parameter for leaf predicted values. These are set by gamma and reg_lambbda in the XGBoost parametrization. Together, these provide powerful new controls to reduce overfitting due to overly complex tree boosters. Note that \\(\\gamma=\\lambda=0\\) reduces the objective back to an unregularized loss function as used in the classic GBM.\n\n\nAn Aside on Newton’s Method\nAs we’ll see soon, XGBoost uses Newton’s Method to minimize its objective function, so let’s start with a quick refresher.\nNewton’s method is an iterative procedure for minimizing a function \\(s(x)\\). At each step we have some input \\(x_t\\), and our goal is to find a nudge value \\(u\\) such that\n\\[ s(x_t + u) \\le s(x_t)\\]\nTo find a good nudge value \\(u\\), we generate a local quadratic approximation of the function in the neighborhood of the input \\(x_t\\), and then we find the input value that would bring us to the minimum of the quadratic approximation.\n\n\n\nSchematic of Newton’s method\n\n\nThe figure shows a single Newton step where we start at \\(x_t\\), find the local quadratic approximation, and then jump a distance \\(u\\) along the \\(x\\)-axis to land at the minimum of the quadratic. If we iterate in this way, we are likely to land close to the minimum of \\(s(x)\\).\nSo how do we compute the quadratic approximation? We use the second order Taylor series expansion of \\(s(x)\\) near the point \\(x_t\\).\n\\[ s(x_t + u) \\approx  s(x_t) + s'(x_t)u + \\frac{1}{2} s''(x_t) u^2 \\]\nTo find the nudge value \\(u\\) that minimizes the quadratic approximation, we can take the derivative with respect to \\(u\\), set it to zero, and solve for \\(u\\).\n\\[ 0 = \\frac{d}{du}  \\left ( s(x_t) + s'(x_t)u + \\frac{1}{2} s''(x_t) u^2 \\right ) = s'(x_t) + s''(x_t) u \\]\n\\[\\rightarrow u^* = -\\frac{s'(x_t)}{s''(x_t)} \\]\nAnd as long as \\(s''(x_t)&gt;0\\) (i.e., the parabola is pointing up), \\(s(x_t + u^*) \\le s(x_t)\\).\n\n\nTree Boosting with Newton’s Method\nThis lands us at the heart of XGBoost, which uses Newton’s method, rather than gradient descent, to guide each round of boosting. This explanation will correspond very closely to section 2.2 of the XGBoost paper, but here I’ll explicitly spell out some of the intermediate steps which are omitted from their derivation, and you’ll get some additional commentary from me along the way.\n\nNewton Descent in Tree Space\nSuppose we’ve done \\(t-1\\) boosting rounds, and we want to add the \\(t\\)-th booster to our composite model. Our current model’s prediction for instance \\(i\\) is \\(\\hat{y}_i^{(t-1)}\\). If we add a new tree booster \\(f_t\\) to our model, the objective function would give\n\\[ L^{(t)} = \\sum_{i=1}^n l(y_i, \\hat{y}_i^{(t-1)} + f_t(\\mathbf{x}_i)) + \\Omega(f_t) \\]\nWe need to choose \\(f_t\\) so that it decreases the loss, i.e. we want\n\\[ l(y_i, \\hat{y}_i^{(t-1)} + f_t(\\mathbf{x}_i)) \\le l(y_i, \\hat{y}_i^{(t-1)})\\]\nDoes that sound familiar? In the previous section we used Newton’s method to find a value of \\(u\\) that would make \\(s(x_t + u) \\le s(x_t)\\). Let’s try the same thing with our loss function. To be explicit, the parallels are: \\(s(\\cdot) \\rightarrow l(y_i, \\cdot)\\), \\(x_t \\rightarrow \\hat{y}_i^{(t-1)}\\), and \\(u \\rightarrow f_t(\\mathbf{x}_i)\\).\nLet’s start by finding the second order Taylor series approximation for the loss around the point \\(\\hat{y}_i^{(t-1)}\\).\n\\[ l(y_i, \\hat{y}_i^{(t-1)} + f_t(\\mathbf{x}_i)) \\approx l(y_i, \\hat{y}_i^{(t-1)}) + g_i f_t(\\mathbf{x}_i) + \\frac{1}{2} h_i f_t(\\mathbf{x}_i)^2 \\]\nwhere\n\\[ g_i = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\hat{y}_i^{(t-1)}} l(y_i, \\hat{y}_i^{(t-1)})\\]\nand\n\\[ h_i = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial^2 \\hat{y}_i^{(t-1)}} l(y_i, \\hat{y}_i^{(t-1)})\\]\nare the first and second order partial derivatives of the loss with respect to the current predictions. The XGBoost paper calls these the gradients and hessians, respectively. Remember that when we specify an actual loss function to use, we would also specify the functional form of the gradients and hessians, so that they are directly computable.\nNow we can go back and substitute our quadratic approximation in for the loss function to get an approximation of the objective function in the neighborhood of \\(\\hat{y}_i^{(t-1)}\\)..\n\\[ L^{(t)} \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^n [l(y_i, \\hat{y}_i^{(t-1)}) + g_i f_t(\\mathbf{x}_i) + \\frac{1}{2} h_i f_t(\\mathbf{x}_i)^2] + \\Omega(f_t) \\]\nSince \\(l(y_i,\\hat{y}_i^{(t-1)})\\) is constant regardless of our choice of \\(f_t\\), we can drop it and instead work with the modified objective, which gives us Equation (3) from the paper.\n\\[ \\tilde{L}^{(t)} = \\sum_{i=1}^n [ g_i f_t(\\mathbf{x}_i) + \\frac{1}{2} h_i f_t(\\mathbf{x}_i)^2] + \\Omega(f_t) \\]\nNow the authors are about to do something great. They’re about to show how to directly compute the optimal prediction values for the leaf nodes of \\(f_t\\). We’ll circle back in a moment about how we find a good structure for \\(f_t\\), i.e. good node splits, but we’re going to find the optimal predicted values for any tree structure having \\(T\\) terminal nodes. Let \\(I_j\\) denote the set of instances \\(i\\) that are in the \\(j\\)-th leaf node of \\(f_t\\). Then we can rewrite the objective.\n\\[ \\tilde{L}^{(t)} = \\sum_{j=1}^T \\left [ \\sum_{i \\in I_j} g_i f_t(\\mathbf{x}_i) + \\frac{1}{2}  \\sum_{i \\in I_j} h_i f_t(\\mathbf{x}_i)^2 \\right ] + \\Omega(f_t)\\]\nWe notice that for all instances in \\(I_j\\), the tree yields the same predicted value \\(f_t(\\mathbf{x}_i)=w_j\\). Substituting in \\(w_j\\) for the predicted values and expanding \\(\\Omega(f_t)\\) we get\n\\[ \\tilde{L}^{(t)} = \\sum_{j=1}^T \\left [ \\sum_{i \\in I_j} g_i w_j + \\frac{1}{2}  \\sum_{i \\in I_j} h_i w_j^2 \\right ] + \\gamma T + \\frac{1}{2} \\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^T w_j^2\\]\nRearranging terms we obtain Equation (4).\n\\[ \\tilde{L}^{(t)} = \\sum_{j=1}^T \\left [ w_j \\sum_{i \\in I_j} g_i + \\frac{1}{2}  w_j^2 \\left ( \\sum_{i \\in I_j} h_i + \\lambda \\right )  \\right ] + \\gamma T \\]\nFor each leaf node \\(j\\), our modified objective function is quadratic in \\(w_j\\). To find the optimal predicted values we take the derivative, set to zero, and solve for \\(w_j\\).\n\\[ 0 = \\frac{d}{dw_j} \\left [ w_j \\sum_{i \\in I_j} g_i + \\frac{1}{2}  w_j^2 \\left ( \\sum_{i \\in I_j} h_i + \\lambda \\right )  \\right ] = \\left ( \\sum_{i \\in I_j} h_i + \\lambda \\right ) w_j + \\sum_{i \\in I_j} g_i \\]\nThis yields Equation (5).\n\\[ w_j^* = - \\frac{\\sum_{i \\in I_j} g_i } {\\sum_{i \\in I_j} h_i + \\lambda } \\]\n\n\nSplit Finding\nNow that we know how to find the optimal predicted value for any leaf node, we need to identify a criterion for finding a good tree structure, which boils down to finding the best split for a given node. Back in the [decision tree from scratch](/decision-tree-from-scratch post, we derived a split evaluation metric based on the reduction in the objective function associated with a particular split.\nTo do that, first we need a way to compute the objective function given a particular tree structure. Substituting the optimal predicted values \\(w_j^*\\) into the objective function, we get Equation (6).\n\\[ \\tilde{L}^{(t)} = -\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{j=1}^T \\frac{ (\\sum_{i \\in I_j} g_i )^2 } {\\sum_{i \\in I_j} h_i + \\lambda} + \\gamma T \\]\nWe can then evaluate potential splits by comparing the objective before making a split to the objective after making a split, where the split with the maximum reduction in objective (a.k.a. gain) is best.\nMore formally, let \\(I\\) be the set of \\(n\\) data instances in the current node, and let \\(I_L\\) and \\(I_R\\) be the instances that fall into the left and right child nodes of a proposed split. Let \\(L\\) be the total loss for all instances in the node, while \\(L_L\\) and \\(L_R\\) are the losses for the left and right child nodes. The total loss contributed by instances in node \\(I\\) prior to any split is\n\\[L_{\\text{before split}} = -\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{ (\\sum_{i \\in I} g_i )^2 } {\\sum_{i \\in I} h_i + \\lambda} + \\gamma \\]\nAnd the loss after splitting \\(I\\) into \\(I_L\\) and \\(I_R\\) is\n\\[L_{\\text{after split}} = L_L + L_R = -\\frac{1}{2}  \\frac{ (\\sum_{i \\in I_L} g_i )^2 } {\\sum_{i \\in I_L} h_i + \\lambda} -\\frac{1}{2}  \\frac{ (\\sum_{i \\in I_R} g_i )^2 } {\\sum_{i \\in I_R} h_i + \\lambda} + 2 \\gamma \\]\nThe gain from this split is then\n\\[ \\Delta L = L_{\\text{before split}} -  L_{\\text{after split}} = L - (L_L + L_R)\\] \\[\\Delta L = \\frac{1}{2} \\left [ \\frac{ (\\sum_{i \\in I_L} g_i )^2 } {\\sum_{i \\in I_L} h_i + \\lambda} + \\frac{ (\\sum_{i \\in I_R} g_i )^2 } {\\sum_{i \\in I_R} h_i + \\lambda} - \\frac{ (\\sum_{i \\in I} g_i )^2 } {\\sum_{i \\in I} h_i + \\lambda} \\right ] - \\gamma \\]\nwhich is Equation (7) from the paper. In practice it makes sense to accept a split only if the gain is positive, thus the \\(\\gamma\\) parameter sets the minimum gain required to make a further split. This is why \\(\\gamma\\) can be set with the parameter gamma or the more descriptivemin_loss_split."

    "section": "Tree Booster Innovations",
    "text": "Tree Booster Innovations\n\nMissing Values and Sparsity-Aware Split Finding\nThe XGBoost paper also introduces a modified algorithm for tree split finding which explicitly handles missing feature values. Recall that in order to find the best threshold value for a given feature, we can simply try all possible threshold values, recording the score for each. If some feature values are missing, the XGBoost split finding algorithm simply scores each threshold twice: once with missing value instances in the left node and once with them in the right node. The best split will then specify both the threshold value and to which node instances with missing values should be assigned. The paper calls this the sparsity aware split finding routine, which is defined as Algorithm 2.\n\n\nPreventing Further Splitting\nIn addition to min_loss_split discussed above, XGBoost offers another parameter for limiting further tree splitting called min_child_weight. This name is a little confusing to me because the word “weight” has various meanings. In the context of this parameter, “weight” refers to the sum of the hessians \\(\\sum h_i\\) over instances in the node. For squared error loss \\(h_i=1\\), so this is equivalent to the number of samples. Thus this parameter generalizes the notion of the minimum number of samples allowed in a terminal node.\n\n\nSampling\nXGBoost takes a cue from Random Forest and introduces both column and row subsampling. These sampling methods can prevent overfitting and reduce training time by limiting the amount of data to be processed during boosting.\nLike random forest, XGBoost implements column subsampling, which limits tree split finding to randomly selected subsets of features. XGBoost provides column sampling for each tree, for each depth level within a tree, and for each split point within a tree, controlled by colsample_bytree, colsample_bbylevel, and colsample_bbynode respectively.\nOne interesting distinction is that XGBoost implements row sampling without replacement using subbsample, whereas random forest uses bootstrapping. The choice to bootstrap rows in RF probably spurred from a desire to use as much data as possible while training on the smaller datasets of the 1990’s when RF was developed. With larger datasets and the ability to generate a large number of trees, XGBoost simply takes a subsample of rows for each tree."

    "section": "Scalability",
    "text": "Scalability\nEven though we’re focused on statistical learning, I figured I’d comment on why XGBoost is highly scalable. Basically it boils down to efficient, parallelizable, and distributable methods for growing trees. You’ll notice there is a tree_method parameter which allows you to choose between the greedy exact algorithm (like the one we discussed in the decision tree from scratch post) and the approximate algorithm, which offers various scalability-related functionality, notably including the ability to consider only a small number of candidate split points instead of trying all possible splits. The algorithm also uses clever tricks like pre-sorting data for split finding and caching frequently needed values.\n\nWhy XGBoost is so Successful\nAs I mentioned in the intro, XGBoost is simply a very good implementation of the gradient boosting tree model. Therefore it inherits all the benefits of decision trees and tree ensembles, while making even further improvements over the classic gradient boosting machine. These improvements boil down to\n\nmore ways to control overfitting\nelegant handling of custom objectives\nscalability\n\nFirst, XGBoost introduces two new tree regularization hyperparameters \\(\\gamma\\) and \\(\\lambda\\) which are baked directly into its objective function. Combining these with the additional column and row sampling functionality provides a variety of ways to reduce overfitting.\nSecond, the XGBoost formulation provides a much more elegant way to train models on custom objective functions. Recall that for custom objectives, the classic GBM finds tree structure by fitting a squared error decision tree to the gradients of the loss function and then sets each leaf’s predicted value by running a numerical optimization routine to find the optimal predicted value.\nThe XGBoost formulation improves on this two-stage approach by unifying the generation of tree structure and predicted values. Both the split scoring metric and the predicted values are directly computable from the instance gradient and hessian values, which are connected directly back to the overall training objective. This also removes the need for additional numerical optimizations, which contributes to speed, stability, and scalability.\nFinally, speaking of scalability, XGBoost emerged at a time when industrial dataset size was exploding. Many use cases require scalable ML systems, and all use cases benefit from faster training and higher model development velocity."

You see, a lot has been going on here at the Random Realizations Remote Global Headquarters that has distracted from producing the high-quality data science content that you’re used to. Mostly I went on hiatus from work and started traveling, which turns out to be it’s own full time job. I had aspirations of writing more after leaving work, but of course, after leaving, I couldn’t be bothered to sit down at my laptop and type stuff about data science to yall. After all, life is bigger than that.\nWhen I finally felt like opening up my laptop, I was confronted with an email from the maintainers of fastpages, the open source content management system (CMS) I originally used to create this blog, notifying me that the project was being deprecated and that I would need to migrate my content to some other platform.\nBoo.\nThat didn’t sound like much fun, so I spent another few months ignoring the blog. But eventually, dear reader, I decided it was time to roll up my sleeves and get this blog thriving once again.\nOk so fastpages was going to be deprecated, and I needed to find a new CMS. My requirements were pretty simple: I wanted to write the blog posts with jupyter notebook, and I wanted to host the site on my own domain. Helpfully, the former maintainers of fastpages recommended an alternative CMS called Quarto which I had never heard of. Apparently I had been living under a rock because Quarto appears to be all the rage. Quarto’s website says it’s an open-source scientific and technical publishing system. I think it’s fair to think of it as a way to render plain text or source code from languages like python, R, and julia into a variety of different published formats like websites, books, or journal articles. It was developed by the good folks over at RStudio, and the project has a pretty active following over on github, so I think it’s less likely to suddenly disappear like fastpages.\nSo anyway, I’ve been migrating my content over into this new quarto universe.\nYou mayofficially consider this blog resurrected from the dead, because this is the first new post published after the migration. The site has a bit of a new look and feel, so I hope you like it. Do let me know in the comments if you find anything amiss with the new website. Otherwise we’ll just assume it’s fabulous.\nI’m working on a post about how to create a blog with quarto using jupyter and python, so you can too!\nSee you in more posts real soon! Love, Matt."

    "section": "Binary Tree Data Structure",
    "text": "Binary Tree Data Structure\nA decision tree takes a dataset with features and a target, partitions the feature space into chunks, and assigns a prediction value to each chunk. Since each partitioning step divides one chunk in two, and since the partitioning is done recursively, it’s natural to use a binary tree data structure to represent a decision tree.\nThe basic idea of the binary tree is that we define a class to represent nodes in the tree. If we want to add children to a given node, we simply assign them as attributes of the parent node. The child nodes we add are themselves instances of the same class, so we can add children to them in the same way.\nLet’s start out with a simple class for our decision tree. It takes a single value called max_depth as input, which will dictate how many layers of child nodes should be inserted below the root. This controls the depth of the tree. As long as max_depth is positive, the parent will instantiate two new instances of the binary tree node class, passing along max_depth decremented by one and attaching the two children to itself as attributes called left and right.\n\nimport math\nimport numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n\nclass DecisionTree():\n\n        def __init__(self, max_depth):\n            assert max_depth &gt;= 0, 'max_depth must be nonnegative'\n            self.max_depth = max_depth\n            if max_depth &gt; 0:\n                self.left = DecisionTree(max_depth=max_depth-1)\n                self.right = DecisionTree(max_depth=max_depth-1)\n\nLet’s make a new instance of our decision tree class, a tree with depth 2.\n\nt = DecisionTree(max_depth=2)\n\n\n\n\nBinary tree structure diagram\n\n\nWe can access individual nodes and check their value of max_depth.\n\nt.max_depth, t.left.max_depth, t.left.right.max_depth\n\n(2, 1, 0)\n\n\nOur full decision tree can expand on this idea where each node receives some input, modifies it, creates two child nodes, and passes the modified input along to them. Specifically, each node in our decision tree will receive a dataset, determine how best to split the dataset into two parts, create two child nodes, and pass one part of the data to the left child and the other part to the right child.\nAll we have to do now is add some additional functionality to our decision tree. First we’ll start by capturing all the inputs we need to grow a tree, which include the feature dataframe X, the target array y, max_depth to explicitly limit tree depth, min_samples_leaf to specify the minimum number of observations that are allowed in a leaf node, and an optional idxs which specifies the indices of data that the node should use. The indices argument is useful for users of our decision tree because it will allow them to implement row subsampling in ensemble methods like random forest. It will also be handy for internal use inside the decision tree when passing data along to child nodes; instead of passing copies of the two data subsets, we’ll just pass a reference to the full dataset and pass along a set of indices to identify that node’s instance subset.\nOnce we get our input, we’ll do a little bit of input validation and store things that we want to keep as object attributes. In case this is a leaf node, we’ll go ahead and compute its predicted value; since this is a regression tree, the prediction is just the mean of the target y. We’ll also go ahead and initialize a score metric which we’ll use to help us find the best split later; since lower scores are going to be better, we’ll initialize it to positive infinity. Finally, we’ll push the logic to add child nodes into a method called _maybe_insert_child_nodes that we’ll define next.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\na leading underscore in a method name indicates the method is for internal use and not part of the user-facing API of the class.\n\n\n\nclass DecisionTree():\n\n    def __init__(self, X, y, min_samples_leaf=5, max_depth=6, idxs=None):\n        assert max_depth &gt;= 0, 'max_depth must be nonnegative'\n        assert min_samples_leaf &gt; 0, 'min_samples_leaf must be positive'\n        self.min_samples_leaf, self.max_depth = min_samples_leaf, max_depth\n        if isinstance(y, pd.Series): y = y.values\n        if idxs is None: idxs = np.arange(len(y))\n        self.X, self.y, self.idxs = X, y, idxs\n        self.n, self.c = len(idxs), X.shape[1]\n        self.value = np.mean(y[idxs]) # node's prediction value\n        self.best_score_so_far = float('inf') # initial loss before split finding\n        if self.max_depth &gt; 0:\n            self._maybe_insert_child_nodes()\n            \n    def _maybe_insert_child_nodes(self):\n        pass\n\nNow in order to test our class, we’ll need some actual data. We can use the same scikit-learn diabetes data from the last post.\n\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_diabetes\n\nX, y = load_diabetes(as_frame=True, return_X_y=True)\n\n\nt = DecisionTree(X, y, min_samples_leaf=5, max_depth=5)\n\nSo far, so good."

To find the best valid split, we need to loop through the columns and search each one for the best valid split. Again we’ll push the logic of finding the best split into a function that we’ll define later. Next if no split was found, we need to bail by returning before trying to insert the child nodes. To check if this node is a leaf (i.e. it shouldn’t have child nodes), we define a property called is_leaf which will just check if the best score so far is still infinity, in which case no split was found and the node is a leaf.\nIf a valid split was found, then we need to insert the child nodes. We’ll assume that our split finding function assigned attributes called split_feature_idx and threshold to tell us the split feature’s index and the split threshold value. We then use these to compute the indices of the data to be passed to the child nodes; the left child gets instances where the split feature value is less than or equal to the threshold, and the right child node gets instances where the split feature value is greater than the threshold. Then we create two new decision trees, passing the corresponding data indices to each and assigning them to the left and right attributes of the current node.\n\n    def _maybe_insert_child_nodes(self):\n        for j in range(self.c): \n            self._find_better_split(j)\n        if self.is_leaf: # do not insert children\n            return \n        x = self.X.values[self.idxs,self.split_feature_idx]\n        left_idx = np.nonzero(x &lt;= self.threshold)[0]\n        right_idx = np.nonzero(x &gt; self.threshold)[0]\n        self.left = DecisionTree(self.X, self.y, self.min_samples_leaf, \n                                  self.max_depth - 1, self.idxs[left_idx])\n        self.right = DecisionTree(self.X, self.y, self.min_samples_leaf, \n                                  self.max_depth - 1, self.idxs[right_idx])\n\n    def _find_better_split(self, feature_idx):\n        pass\n    \n    @property\n    def is_leaf(self): return self.best_score_so_far == float('inf')\n\nTo test these new methods , we can assign them to our DecisionTree class and create a new class instance to make sure things are still working.\n\nDecisionTree._maybe_insert_child_nodes = _maybe_insert_child_nodes\nDecisionTree._find_better_split = _find_better_split\nDecisionTree.is_leaf = is_leaf\nt = DecisionTree(X, y, min_samples_leaf=5, max_depth=6)\n\nYep, we’re still looking good."

    "text": "Split Finding\nNow we need to fill in the functionality of the split finding method. The overall strategy is to consider every possible way to split on the current feature, measuring the quality of each potential split with some scoring mechanism, and keeping track of the best split we’ve seen so far. We’ll come back to the issue of how to try all the possible splits in a moment, but let’s start by figuring out how to score a particular potential split.\nLike other machine learning models, trees are trained by attempting to minimize some loss function that measures how well the model predicts the target data. We’ll be training our regression tree to minimize squared error.\n\\[ L = \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i-\\hat{y}_i)^2\\]\nFor a given node, we can replace \\(\\hat{y}\\) with \\(\\bar{y}\\) because each node uses the sample mean of its target instances as its prediction. We can then rewrite the loss for a given node as\n\\[ L = \\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - \\bar{y})^2 \\] \\[  = \\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i^2 -2y_i\\bar{y} + \\bar{y}^2)  \\] \\[  = \\sum_{i=1}^ny_i^2 -2\\bar{y}\\sum_{i=1}^ny_i + n\\bar{y}^2 \\] \\[  = \\sum_{i=1}^ny_i^2 - \\frac{1}{n} \\left ( \\sum_{i=1}^ny_i \\right )^2 \\]\nWe can then evaluate potential splits by comparing the loss after splitting to the loss before splitting, where the split with the greatest loss reduction is best. Let’s work out a simple expression for the loss reduction from a given split.\nLet \\(I\\) be the set of \\(n\\) data instances in the current node, and let \\(I_L\\) and \\(I_R\\) be the instances that fall into the left and right child nodes of a proposed split. Let \\(L\\) be the total loss for all instances in the node, while \\(L_L\\) and \\(L_R\\) are the losses for the left and right child nodes. The total loss contributed by instances in \\(I\\) prior to any split is\n\\[L_{\\text{before split}} = L =  \\sum_{i \\in I} y_i^2 - \\frac{1}{n} \\left ( \\sum_{i \\in I} y_i \\right )^2 \\]\nAnd the loss after splitting \\(I\\) into \\(I_L\\) and \\(I_R\\) is\n\\[L_{\\text{after split}} = L_L + L_R =  \\sum_{i \\in I_L} y_i^2 - \\frac{1}{n_L} \\left ( \\sum_{i \\in I_L} y_i \\right )^2 + \\sum_{i \\in I_R} y_i^2 - \\frac{1}{n_R} \\left ( \\sum_{i \\in I_R} y_i \\right )^2 \\]\nThe reduction in loss from this split is\n\\[ \\Delta L = L_{\\text{after split}} -  L_{\\text{before split}} = (L_L + L_R) - L \\] \\[  = \\sum_{i \\in I_L} y_i^2 - \\frac{1}{n_L} \\left ( \\sum_{i \\in I_L} y_i \\right )^2 + \\sum_{i \\in I_R} y_i^2 - \\frac{1}{n_R} \\left ( \\sum_{i \\in I_R} y_i \\right )^2 - \\left ( \\sum_{i \\in I} y_i^2 - \\frac{1}{n} \\left ( \\sum_{i \\in I} y_i \\right )^2 \\right ) \\]\nSince \\(I = I_L \\cup I_R\\) the \\(\\sum y^2\\) terms cancel and we can simplify.\n\\[ \\Delta L = - \\frac{1}{n_L} \\left ( \\sum_{i \\in I_L} y_i \\right )^2\n- \\frac{1}{n_R} \\left ( \\sum_{i \\in I_R} y_i \\right )^2\n+ \\frac{1}{n} \\left ( \\sum_{i \\in I} y_i \\right )^2  \\]\nThis is a really nice formulation of the split scoring metric from a computational complexity perspective. We can sort the data by the feature values then, starting with the smallest min_samples_leaf instances in the left node and the rest in the right node, we check the score. Then to check the next split, we simply move a single target value from the right node into the left node, updating the score by subtracting it from the right node’s partial sum and adding it to the left node’s partial sum. The third term is constant for all splits, so we only need to compute it once. If any split’s score is lower than the best score so far, then we update the best score so far, the split feature, and the threshold value. When we’re done we can be sure we found the best possible split. The time bottleneck is the sort, which puts us at an average time complexity of \\(O(n\\log n)\\).\n\n    def _find_better_split(self, feature_idx):\n        x = self.X.values[self.idxs,feature_idx]\n        y = self.y[self.idxs]\n        sort_idx = np.argsort(x)\n        sort_y, sort_x = y[sort_idx], x[sort_idx]\n        sum_y, n = y.sum(), len(y)\n        sum_y_right, n_right = sum_y, n\n        sum_y_left, n_left = 0., 0\n    \n        for i in range(0, self.n - self.min_samples_leaf):\n            y_i, x_i, x_i_next = sort_y[i], sort_x[i], sort_x[i + 1]\n            sum_y_left += y_i; sum_y_right -= y_i\n            n_left += 1; n_right -= 1\n            if  n_left &lt; self.min_samples_leaf or x_i == x_i_next:\n                continue\n            score = - sum_y_left**2 / n_left - sum_y_right**2 / n_right + sum_y**2 / n\n            if score &lt; self.best_score_so_far:\n                self.best_score_so_far = score\n                self.split_feature_idx = feature_idx\n                self.threshold = (x_i + x_i_next) / 2\n\nAgain, we assign the split finding method to our class and instantiate a new tree to make sure things are still working.\n\nDecisionTree._find_better_split = _find_better_split\nt = DecisionTree(X, y, min_samples_leaf=5, max_depth=6)\nX.columns[t.split_feature_idx], t.threshold\n\n('s5', -0.0037611760063045703)\n\n\nNice!

    "section": "Prepare raw data for XGBoost",
    "text": "Prepare raw data for XGBoost\nWhen faced with a new tabular dataset for modeling, we have two format considerations: data types and missingness. From the call to df.info() above, we can see we have both mixed types and missing values.\nWhen it comes to missing values, some models like the gradient booster or random forest in scikit-learn require purely non-missing inputs. One of the great strengths of XGBoost is that it relaxes this requirement, allowing us to pass in missing feature values, so we don’t have to worry about them.\nRegarding data types, all ML models for tabular data require inputs to be numeric, either integers or floats, so we’re going to have to deal with those object columns.\n\nEncode string features\nThe simplest way to encode string variables is to map each unique string value to an integer; this is called integer encoding.\nWe have a couple of options for how to implement this transformation: pandas categoricals or the scikit-learn label encoder. We can use the categorical type in pandas to generate mappings from string values to integers for each string feature. The category type is a bit like the factor type in R. Pandas stores the underlying data as integers, and it also keeps a mapping from the integers to the string values. XGBoost will be able to access the integers for model fitting. This is nice because we can still access the actual categories which can be helpful when we start taking a closer look at the data. If you prefer, you can also use the scikit-learn label encoder to replace the string columns with their integer-mapped counterparts.\n\ndef encode_string_features(df, use_cats=True):\n    out_df = df.copy()\n    for feature, feature_type in df.dtypes.items():\n        if feature_type == 'object':\n            if use_cats:\n                out_df[feature] = out_df[feature].astype('category')\n            else:\n                from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\n                out_df[feature] = LabelEncoder() \\\n                    .fit_transform(out_df[feature].astype('str'))\n    return out_df\n\ndf = encode_string_features(df, use_cats=False)\n\n\n\nEncode date and timestamp features\nWhile dates feel sort of numeric, they are not numbers, so we need to transform them into numeric columns. Unfortunately, encoding timestamps isn’t as straightforward as encoding strings, so we actually might need to engage in a little bit of feature engineering. A single date has many different attributes, e.g. days since epoch, year, quarter, month, day, day of year, day of week, is holiday, etc. As a starting point, we can just add a few of these attributes as features. Once a feature is represented as a date or timestamp data type, you can access various attributes via the dt attribute.\n\ndef encode_datetime_features(df, datetime_features, datetime_attributes):\n    out_df = df.copy()\n    for datetime_feature in datetime_features:\n        for datetime_attribute in datetime_attributes:\n            if datetime_attribute == 'days_since_epoch':\n                out_df[f'{datetime_feature}_{datetime_attribute}'] = \\\n                    (out_df[datetime_feature] \n                     - pd.Timestamp(year=1970, month=1, day=1)).dt.days\n            else:\n                out_df[f'{datetime_feature}_{datetime_attribute}'] = \\\n                    getattr(out_df[datetime_feature].dt, datetime_attribute)\n    return out_df\n\ndatetime_features = [\n    'saledate',\n]\ndatetime_attributes = [\n    'year',\n    'month',\n    'day',\n    'quarter',\n    'day_of_year',\n    'day_of_week',\n    'days_since_epoch',\n]\n\ndf = encode_datetime_features(df, datetime_features, datetime_attributes)\n\n\n\nTransform the target if necessary\nIn the interest of speed and efficiency, we didn’t bother doing any EDA with the feature data. Part of my justification for this is that trees are incredibly robust to outliers, colinearity, missingness, and other assorted nonsense in the feature data. However, they are not necessarily robust to nonsense in the target variable, so it’s worth having a look at it before proceeding any further.\n\ndf.SalePrice.hist(); plt.xlabel('SalePrice');\n\n\n\n\nOften when predicting prices it makes sense to use log price, especially when they span multiple orders of magnitude or have a strong right skew. These data look pretty friendly, lacking outliers and exhibiting only a mild positive skew; we could probably get away without doing any transformation. But checking the evaluation metric used to score the Kagle competition, we see they’re using root mean squared log error. That’s equivalent to using RMSE on log-transformed target data, so let’s go ahead and work with log prices.\n\ndf['logSalePrice'] = np.log1p(df['SalePrice'])\ndf.logSalePrice.hist(); plt.xlabel('logSalePrice');"

Just run something like list(df.columns) in a cel to get a copy-pasteable list of columns, then edit it down to the full list of features, i.e. remove the target, date columns, and other non-feature columns..\n\n# list(df.columns)\n\n\nfeatures = [\n    'SalesID',\n    'MachineID',\n    'ModelID',\n    'datasource',\n    'auctioneerID',\n    'YearMade',\n    'MachineHoursCurrentMeter',\n    'UsageBand',\n    'fiModelDesc',\n    'fiBaseModel',\n    'fiSecondaryDesc',\n    'fiModelSeries',\n    'fiModelDescriptor',\n    'ProductSize',\n    'fiProductClassDesc',\n    'state',\n    'ProductGroup',\n    'ProductGroupDesc',\n    'Drive_System',\n    'Enclosure',\n    'Forks',\n    'Pad_Type',\n    'Ride_Control',\n    'Stick',\n    'Transmission',\n    'Turbocharged',\n    'Blade_Extension',\n    'Blade_Width',\n    'Enclosure_Type',\n    'Engine_Horsepower',\n    'Hydraulics',\n    'Pushblock',\n    'Ripper',\n    'Scarifier',\n    'Tip_Control',\n    'Tire_Size',\n    'Coupler',\n    'Coupler_System',\n    'Grouser_Tracks',\n    'Hydraulics_Flow',\n    'Track_Type',\n    'Undercarriage_Pad_Width',\n    'Stick_Length',\n    'Thumb',\n    'Pattern_Changer',\n    'Grouser_Type',\n    'Backhoe_Mounting',\n    'Blade_Type',\n    'Travel_Controls',\n    'Differential_Type',\n    'Steering_Controls',\n    'saledate_year',\n    'saledate_month',\n    'saledate_day',\n    'saledate_quarter',\n    'saledate_day_of_year',\n    'saledate_day_of_week',\n    'saledate_days_since_epoch'\n]\n\ntarget = 'logSalePrice'\n\n\n\nSplit the data into training and validation sets\nNext we split the dataset into a training set and a validation set. Of course since we’re going to evaluate against the validation set a number of times as we iterate, it’s best practice to keep a separate test set reserved to check our final model to ensure it generalizes well. Assuming that final test set is hidden away, we can use the rest of the data for training and validation.\nThere are two main ways we might want to select the validation set. If there isn’t a temporal ordering of the observations, we might be able to randomly sample. In practice, it’s much more common that observations have a temporal ordering, and that models are trained on observations up to a certain time and used to predict on observations occuring after that time. Since this data is temporal, we don’t want to split randomly; instead we’ll split on observation date, reserving the latest observations for the validation set.\n\n# Temporal Validation Set\ndef train_test_split_temporal(df, datetime_column, n_test):\n    idx_sort = np.argsort(df[datetime_column])\n    idx_train, idx_test = idx_sort[:-n_valid], idx_sort[-n_valid:]\n    return df.iloc[idx_train, :], df.iloc[idx_test, :]\n\n\n# Random Validation Set\ndef train_test_split_random(df, n_test):\n    np.random.seed(42)\n    idx_sort = np.random.permutation(len(df))\n    idx_train, idx_test = idx_sort[:-n_valid], idx_sort[-n_valid:]\n    return df.iloc[idx_train, :], df.iloc[idx_test, :]\n\nmy_train_test_split = lambda d, n_valid: train_test_split_temporal(d, 'saledate', n_valid)\n# my_train_test_split = lambda d, n_valid: train_test_split_random(d, n_valid)\n\n\nn_valid = 12000\ntrain_df, valid_df = my_train_test_split(df, n_valid)\n\ntrain_df.shape, valid_df.shape\n\n((389125, 61), (12000, 61))\n\n\n\n\nCreate DMatrix data objects\nXGBoost uses a data type called dense matrix for efficient training and prediction, so next we need to create DMatrix objects for our training and validation datasets.\n\nIf you prefer to use the scikit-learn interface to XGBoost, you don’t need to create these dense matrix objects. More on that below.\n\n\ndtrain = xgb.DMatrix(data=train_df[features], label=train_df[target], enable_categorical=True)\ndvalid = xgb.DMatrix(data=valid_df[features], label=valid_df[target], enable_categorical=True)\n\n\n\nSet the XGBoost parameters\nXGBoost has numerous hyperparameters. Fortunately, just a handful of them tend to be the most influential; furthermore, the default values are not bad in most situations. I like to start out with a dictionary containing the default parameter values for just the ones I think are most important. For training there is one required boosting parameter called num_boost_round which I set to 50 as a starting point; you can make this smaller initially if training takes too long.\n\n# default values for important parameters\nparams = {\n    'learning_rate': 0.3,\n    'max_depth': 6,\n    'min_child_weight': 1,\n    'subsample': 1,\n    'colsample_bynode': 1,\n    'objective': 'reg:squarederror',\n}\nnum_boost_round = 50\n\n\n\nTrain the XGBoost model\nCheck out the documentation on the learning API to see all the training options. During training, I like to have XGBoost print out the evaluation metric on the train and validation set after every few boosting rounds and again at the end of training; that can be done by setting evals and verbose_eval. You can also save the evaluation results in a dictionary passed into evals_result to inspect and plot the objective curve over the training iterations.\n\nevals_result = {}\nm = xgb.train(params=params, dtrain=dtrain, num_boost_round=num_boost_round,\n              evals=[(dtrain, 'train'), (dvalid, 'valid')],\n              verbose_eval=10,\n              evals_result=evals_result)\n\n[0] train-rmse:6.74422  valid-rmse:6.79733\n[10]    train-rmse:0.34798  valid-rmse:0.37158\n[20]    train-rmse:0.26289  valid-rmse:0.28239\n[30]    train-rmse:0.25148  valid-rmse:0.27028\n[40]    train-rmse:0.24375  valid-rmse:0.26420\n[49]    train-rmse:0.23738  valid-rmse:0.25855\n\n\n\n\nTrain the XGBoost model using the sklearn interface\nYou can optionally use the sklearn estimator interface to XGBoost. This will bypass the need to use the DMatrix data objects for training and prediction, and it will allow you to leverage many of the other scikit-learn ecosystem tools like pipelines, parameter search, partial dependence plots, etc. The XGBRegressor is available in the xgboost library that we’ve already imported.\n\n# scikit-learn interface\nreg = xgb.XGBRegressor(n_estimators=num_boost_round, **params)\nreg.fit(train_df[features], train_df[target], \n        eval_set=[(train_df[features], train_df[target]), (valid_df[features], valid_df[target])], \n        verbose=10);\n\n[0] validation_0-rmse:6.74422   validation_1-rmse:6.79733\n[10]    validation_0-rmse:0.34798   validation_1-rmse:0.37158\n[20]    validation_0-rmse:0.26289   validation_1-rmse:0.28239\n[30]    validation_0-rmse:0.25148   validation_1-rmse:0.27028\n[40]    validation_0-rmse:0.24375   validation_1-rmse:0.26420\n[49]    validation_0-rmse:0.23738   validation_1-rmse:0.25855\n\n\nSince not all features of XGBoost are available through the scikit-learn estimator interface, you might want to get the native booster object back out of the sklearn wrapper.\n\nm = reg.get_booster()\n\n\n\nEvaluate the model and check for overfitting\nWe get the model evaluation metrics on the training and validation sets printed to stdout when we use the evals argument to the training API. Typically I just look at those printed metrics, but let’s double check by hand.\n\ndef root_mean_squared_error(y_true, y_pred):\n    return np.sqrt(np.mean((y_true - y_pred)**2))\n\nroot_mean_squared_error(dvalid.get_label(), m.predict(dvalid))\n\n0.25855368\n\n\nSo, how good is that RMSLE of 0.259? Well, checking the Kagle leaderboard for this competition, we would have come in 53rd out of 474, which is in the top 12% of submissions. That’s not bad for 10 minutes of work doing the bare minimum necessary to transform the raw data into a format consumable by XGBoost and then training a model using default hyperparameter values.\n\nNote that we’re using a different validation set from that used for the final leaderboard (which is long closed), but our score is likely still a decent approximation for how we would have done in the competition.\n\nIt can be helpful to take a look at objective curves for training and validation data to get a sense for the extent of overfitting. A huge difference between training and validation performance indicates overfitting. In the below curve, there is very little overfitting, indicating we can be aggressive with hyperparameters that increase model flexibility. More on that soon.\n\npd.DataFrame({\n    'train': evals_result['train']['rmse'],\n    'valid': evals_result['valid']['rmse']\n}).plot(); plt.xlabel('boosting round'); plt.ylabel('objective');\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck feature importance\nIt’s helpful to get an idea of how much the model is using each feature. In following iterations we might want to try dropping low-signal features or examining the important ones more closely for feature engineering ideas. The gigantic caveat to keep in mind here is that there are different measures of feature importance, and each one will give different importances. XGBoost provides three importance measures; I tend to prefer looking at the weight measure because its rankings usually seem most intuitive.\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5,10))\nfeature_importances = pd.Series(m.get_score(importance_type='weight')).sort_values(ascending=False)\nfeature_importances.plot.barh(ax=ax)\nplt.title('Feature Importance');"

Now we enter the model iteration loop in which we adjust features and model parameters to find configurations that have better and better performance.\nLet’s start by putting the feature and target specification, the training/validation split, the model training, and the evaluation all together in one code block that we can copy paste for easy model iteration.\n\nNote that for this process to be effective, model training needs to take less than 10 seconds. Otherwise you’ll be sitting around waiting way too long. If training takes too long, try training on a sample of the training data, or try reducing the number of boosting rounds.\n\n\nfeatures = [\n    'SalesID',\n    'MachineID',\n    'ModelID',\n    'datasource',\n    'auctioneerID',\n    'YearMade',\n    'MachineHoursCurrentMeter',\n    'UsageBand',\n    'fiModelDesc',\n    'fiBaseModel',\n    'fiSecondaryDesc',\n    'fiModelSeries',\n    'fiModelDescriptor',\n    'ProductSize',\n    'fiProductClassDesc',\n    'state',\n    'ProductGroup',\n    'ProductGroupDesc',\n    'Drive_System',\n    'Enclosure',\n    'Forks',\n    'Pad_Type',\n    'Ride_Control',\n    'Stick',\n    'Transmission',\n    'Turbocharged',\n    'Blade_Extension',\n    'Blade_Width',\n    'Enclosure_Type',\n    'Engine_Horsepower',\n    'Hydraulics',\n    'Pushblock',\n    'Ripper',\n    'Scarifier',\n    'Tip_Control',\n    'Tire_Size',\n    'Coupler',\n    'Coupler_System',\n    'Grouser_Tracks',\n    'Hydraulics_Flow',\n    'Track_Type',\n    'Undercarriage_Pad_Width',\n    'Stick_Length',\n    'Thumb',\n    'Pattern_Changer',\n    'Grouser_Type',\n    'Backhoe_Mounting',\n    'Blade_Type',\n    'Travel_Controls',\n    'Differential_Type',\n    'Steering_Controls',\n    'saledate_year',\n    'saledate_month',\n    'saledate_day',\n    'saledate_quarter',\n    'saledate_day_of_year',\n    'saledate_day_of_week',\n    'saledate_days_since_epoch',\n]\n\ntarget = 'logSalePrice'\n\ntrain_df, valid_df = train_test_split_temporal(df, 'saledate', 12000)\ndtrain = xgb.DMatrix(data=train_df[features], label=train_df[target], enable_categorical=True)\ndvalid = xgb.DMatrix(data=valid_df[features], label=valid_df[target], enable_categorical=True)\n\nparams = {\n    'learning_rate': 0.3,\n    'max_depth': 6,\n    'min_child_weight': 1,\n    'subsample': 1,\n    'colsample_bynode': 1,\n    'objective': 'reg:squarederror',\n}\nnum_boost_round = 50\n\nm = xgb.train(params=params, dtrain=dtrain, num_boost_round=num_boost_round,\n              evals=[(dtrain, 'train'), (dvalid, 'valid')],verbose_eval=10)\n\n[0] train-rmse:6.74422  valid-rmse:6.79733\n[10]    train-rmse:0.34798  valid-rmse:0.37158\n[20]    train-rmse:0.26289  valid-rmse:0.28239\n[30]    train-rmse:0.25148  valid-rmse:0.27028\n[40]    train-rmse:0.24375  valid-rmse:0.26420\n[49]    train-rmse:0.23738  valid-rmse:0.25855\n\n\n\nFeature selection\n\nDrop low-importance features\nLet’s try training a model on only the top k most important features.

With our reduced feature set, we’re now ranking 39th on that Kagle leaderboard. Let’s see how far we can get with some hyperparameter tuning.\n\n\n\nTune the XGBoost hyperparameters\nThis is a topic which deserves its own full-length post, but just for fun, here I’ll do a quick and dirty hand tuning without a ton of explanation.\nBroadly speaking, my process is to increase model expressiveness by increasing the maximum tree depth untill it looks like I’m overfitting. At that point, I start pushing tree pruning parameters like min child weight and regularization parameters like lambda to counteract the overfitting. That process lead me to the following parameters.\n\nparams = {\n    'learning_rate': 0.3,\n    'max_depth': 10,\n    'min_child_weight': 14,\n    'lambda': 5,\n    'subsample': 1,\n    'colsample_bynode': 1,\n    'objective': 'reg:squarederror',}\nnum_boost_round = 50\n\nm = xgb.train(params=params, dtrain=dtrain, num_boost_round=num_boost_round,\n              evals=[(dtrain, 'train'), (dvalid, 'valid')], verbose_eval=10)\n\n[0] train-rmse:6.74473  valid-rmse:6.80196\n[10]    train-rmse:0.31833  valid-rmse:0.34151\n[20]    train-rmse:0.22651  valid-rmse:0.24885\n[30]    train-rmse:0.21501  valid-rmse:0.23904\n[40]    train-rmse:0.20897  valid-rmse:0.23645\n[49]    train-rmse:0.20418  valid-rmse:0.23412\n\n\nThat gets us up to 12th place.

Needless to say, I’m pretty excited to finally get things going.\nBefore we dive headlong into the weeds of ML algorithms, statistical methods, and whatever I happen to be learning and teaching at the moment, I figured it would be good to articulate why I’ve felt inspired to get started blogging in the first place.

The latter manifestation of teaching was one of my favorite things about grad school and academia in general.

    "text": "Friedman 2001: TL;DR\nI’ve mentioned this paper a couple of times before, but as far as I can tell, this is the origin of gradient boosting; it is therefore, a seminal work worth reading. You know what, I think you might like to pick up the paper and read it yourself. Like many papers, there is a lot of scary looking math in the first few pages, but if you’ve been following along on this blog, you’ll find that it’s actually totally approachable. This is the kind of thing that cures imposter syndrome, so give it a shot. That said, here’s the TL;DR as I see it.\nThe first part of the paper introduces the idea of fitting models by doing gradient descent in function space, an ingenious idea we spent an entire post demystifying earlier. Friedman goes on to introduce the generic gradient boost algorithm, which works with any differentiable loss function, as well as specific variants for minimizing absolute error, Huber loss, and binary deviance. In terms of hyperparameters, he points out that the learning rate can be used to reduce overfitting, while increased tree depth can help capture more complex interactions among features. He even discusses feature importance and partial dependence methods for interpreting fitted gradient boosting models.\nFriedman concludes by musing about the advantages of gradient boosting with trees. He notes some key advantages afforded by the use of decision trees including no need to rescale input data, robustness against irrelevant input features, and elegant handling of missing feature values. He points out that gradient boosting manages to capitalize on the benefits of decision trees while minimizing their key weakness (crappy accuracy). I think this offers a great insight into why gradient boosting models have become so widespread and successful in practical ML applications."

    "text": "Friedman’s Generic Gradient Boosting Algorithm\nLet’s take a closer look at Friedman’s original gradient boost algorithm, Alg. 1 in Section 3 of the paper (translated into the notation we’ve been using so far).\nLike last time, we have training data \\((\\mathbf{y}, \\mathbf{X})\\) where \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) is a length-\\(n\\) vector of target values, and \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) is an \\(n \\times p\\) matrix with \\(n\\) observations of \\(p\\) features. We also have a differentiable loss function \\(L(\\mathbf{y}, \\mathbf{\\hat{y}}) = \\sum_{i=1}^n l(y_i, \\hat{y}_i)\\), a “learning rate” hyperparameter \\(\\eta\\), and a fixed number of model iterations \\(M\\).\nAlgorithm: gradient_boost\\((\\mathbf{X},\\mathbf{y},L,\\eta, M)\\) returns: model \\(F_M\\)\n\nLet base model \\(F_0(\\mathbf{x}) = c\\), where \\(c = \\text{argmin}_{c} \\sum_{i=1}^n l(y_i, c)\\)\nfor \\(m\\) = \\(0\\) to \\(M-1\\):\n     Let “pseudo-residual” vector \\(\\mathbf{r}_m = -\\nabla_{\\mathbf{\\hat{y}}_m} L(\\mathbf{y},\\mathbf{\\hat{y}}_m)\\)\n     Train decision tree regressor \\(h_m(\\mathbf{X})\\) to predict \\(\\mathbf{r}_m\\) (minimizing squared error)\n     foreach terminal leaf node \\(t \\in h_m\\):\n          Let \\(v = \\text{argmin}_v \\sum_{i \\in t} l(y_i, F_m(\\mathbf{x}_i) + v)\\)\n          Set terminal leaf node \\(t\\) to predict value \\(v\\)\n     \\(F_{m+1}(\\mathbf{X}) = F_{m}(\\mathbf{X}) + \\eta h_m(\\mathbf{X})\\)\nReturn composite model \\(F_M\\)\n\nBy now, most of this is already familiar to us. We begin by setting the base model \\(F_0\\) equal to the constant prediction value that minimizes the loss over all examples in the training dataset (line 1). Then we begin the boosting iterations (line 2), each time computing the negative gradients of the loss with respect to the current model predictions (known as the pseudo residuals) (line 3). We then fit our next decision tree regressor to predict the pseudo residuals (line 4).\nThen we encounter something new on lines 5-7. When we fit a vanilla decision tree regressor to predict pseudo residuals, we’re using mean squared error as the loss function to train the tree. As you might imagine, this works well when the global loss function is also squared error. But if we want to use a global loss other than squared error, there is an additional trick we can use to further increase the composite model’s accuracy. The idea is to continue using squared error to train each decision tree, keeping its structure and split conditions but altering the predicted value in each leaf to help minimize the global loss function. Instead of using the mean target value as the prediction for each node (as we would do when minimizing squared error), we use a numerical optimization method like line search to choose the constant value for that leaf that leads to the best overall loss. This is the same thing we did in line 1 of the algorithm to set the base prediction, but here we choose the optimal prediction for each terminal node of the newly trained decision tree."

Rather than taking center stage, gradient descent operates under the hood, powering the training for a wide range of models including deep neural networks, gradient boosting trees, generalized linear models, and mixed effects models. Getting an intuition for the algorithm will reveal how model fitting actually works and help us to see the common thread connecting a wide range of seemingly unrelated models. In this post we’ll get the intuition for gradient descent with a fresh analogy, develop the mathematical formulation, and ground our understanding by using it to train ourselves a linear regression model."

    "section": "Intuition",
    "text": "Intuition\nBefore we dive into the intuition for gradient descent itself, let’s get a high-level view of why it’s useful in training or fiting a model. Training a model basically means finding the model parameter values that make the model fit a given dataset well. We measure how well a model fits data using a special function variously called a loss or cost or objective function. A loss function takes the dataset and the model as arguments and returns a number that tells us how well our model fits the data. Therefore training is an optimization problem in which we search for the model parameter values that result in the minimum value of the loss function. Enter gradient descent.\nGradient descent is a numerical optimization technique that helps us find the inputs that yield the minimum value of a function. Since most explanations of the gradient descent algorithm seem to use a story about hikers being lost in some foggy mountains, we’re going to try out a new analogy.\nLet’s say you’re at a concert. Remember those? They’re these things that used to happen where people played music and everyone danced and had a great time.\n\nNOTE: Chiming in here in 2023 from a sort-of-post COVID 19 world, happily I can report that concerts and live music are back!\n\nNow suppose at this concert there’s a dance floor which has become a bit sweltering from copious amounts of “getting down”. But the temperature isn’t quite uniform; maybe there’s a cool spot from a ceiling fan somewhere.\n\n\n\ndance floor\n\n\nLet’s get ourselves to that cool spot using the following procedure.\n\nFrom our current location, figure out which direction feels coolest.\nTake a step (or simply shimmy) in that direction.\nRepeat steps 1 and 2 until we reach the coolest spot on the dance floor.\n\nThe crux of this procedure is figuring out, at each step, which direction yields the greatest temperature reduction. Our skin is pretty sensitive to temperature, so we can just use awareness of body sensation to sense which direction feels coolest. Luckily, we have a mathematical equivalent to our skin’s ability to sense local variation in temperature.\n\nDetermine which way to go\nLet \\(f(x,y)\\) be the temperature on the dance floor at position \\((x,y)\\). The direction of fastest decrease in temperature is going to be given by some vector in our \\((x,y)\\) space, e.g.,\n[vector component in \\(x\\) direction, vector component in \\(y\\) direction]\nTurns out that the gradient of a function evaluated at a particular location yields a vector that points in the direction of fastest increase in the function, pretty similar to what we’re looking for. The gradient of \\(f(x,y)\\) is given by\n\\[ \\nabla f(x,y) = \\left [ \\frac{\\partial f(x,y)}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial f(x,y)}{\\partial y} \\right ] \\]\nThe components of the gradient vector are the partial derivatives of our function \\(f(x,y)\\), evaluated at the point \\((x,y)\\). These partial derivatives just tell us the slope of \\(f(x,y)\\) in the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) directions respectively. The intuition is that if \\(\\frac{\\partial f(x,y)}{\\partial x}\\) is a large positive number, then moving in the positive \\(x\\) direction will make \\(f(x,y)\\) increase a lot, whereas if \\(\\frac{\\partial f(x,y)}{\\partial x}\\) is a large negative number, then moving in the negative \\(x\\) direction will make \\(f(x,y)\\) increase a lot.\nIt’s not too hard to see that the direction of fastest decrease is actually just the exact opposite direction from that of fastest increase. Since we can point a vector in the opposite direction by negating its component values, our direction of fastest temperature decrease will be given by the negative gradient of the temperature field \\(-\\nabla f(x,y)\\).\n\n\n\ndance floor with hot and cold sides\n\n\n\n\nTake a step in the right direction\nNow that we have our direction vector, we’re ready to take a step toward the cool part of the dance floor. To do this, we’ll just add our direction vector to our current position. The update rule would look like this.\n\\[ [x_\\text{next}, y_\\text{next}] = [x_\\text{prev}, y_\\text{prev}] - \\nabla f (x_\\text{prev}, y_\\text{prev}) = [x_\\text{prev}, y_\\text{prev}] -  \\left [ \\frac{\\partial f (x_\\text{prev}, y_\\text{prev})}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial f (x_\\text{prev}, y_\\text{prev})}{\\partial y} \\right ] \\]\nIf we iteratively apply this update rule, we’ll end up tracing a trajectory through the \\((x,y)\\) space on the dance floor and we’ll eventually end up at the coolest spot!\n\n\n\ndance floor with trajectory from hot side to cool side\n\n\nGreat success!"

    "section": "General Formulation",
    "text": "General Formulation\nLet’s generalize a bit to get to the form of gradient descent you’ll see in references like the wikipedia article.\nFirst we modify our update equation above to handle functions with more than two arguments. We’ll use a bold \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) to indicate a vector of inputs \\(\\mathbf{x} = [x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_p]\\). Our function \\(f(\\mathbf{x}): \\mathbb{R}^p \\mapsto \\mathbb{R}\\) maps a \\(p\\) dimensional input to a scalar output.\nSecond, instead of displacing our current location with the negative gradient vector itself, we’ll first rescale it with a learning rate parameter. This helps address any issues with units on inputs versus outputs. Imagine the input could range between 0 and 1, but the output ranged from 0 to 1,000. We would need to rescale the partial derivatives so the update step doesn’t send us way too far off in input space.\nFinally, we’ll index our updates with \\(t=0,1,\\dots\\). We’ll run for some prespecified number of iterations or we’ll stop the procedure once the change in \\(f(\\mathbf{x})\\) is sufficiently small from one iteration to the next. Our update equation will look like this.\n\\[\\mathbf{x}_{t+1} = \\mathbf{x}_t - \\eta \\nabla f ( \\mathbf{x}_t) \\]\nIn pseudocode we could write it like this.\n# gradient descent\nx = initial_value_of_x \nfor t in range(n_iterations):  # or some other convergence condition\n    x -= learning_rate * gradient_of_f(x)\nNow let’s see how this algorithm gets used to train models."

    "text": "Training a Linear Regression Model with Gradient Descent\nTo get the intuition for how we use gradient descent to train models, let’s use it to train a linear regression model. Note that we wouldn’t actually use gradient descent to train a linear model in real life since there is an exact analytical solution for the best-fit parameter values.\nAnyway, in the simple linear regression problem we have numerical feature \\(x\\) and numerical target \\(y\\), and we want to find a model of the form\n\\[F(x) = \\alpha + \\beta x\\]\nThis model has two parameters, \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\). Here “training” means finding the parameter values that make \\(F(x)\\) fit our \\(y\\) data best. We measure how well, or really how poorly, our model fits the data by using a loss function that yields a small value when a model fits well. Ordinary least squares is so named because it uses mean squared error as its loss function.\n\\[L(y, F(x)) =  \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - F(x_i))^2  =  \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - (\\alpha + \\beta x_i))^2 \\]\nThe loss function \\(L\\) takes four arguments: \\(x\\), \\(y\\), \\(\\alpha\\), and \\(\\beta\\). But since \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are fixed given our dataset, we could write the loss as \\(L(\\alpha, \\beta | x, y)\\) to emphasize that \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are the only free parameters. So we’re looking for the following.\n\\[\\underset{\\alpha,\\beta}{\\operatorname{argmin}} ~ L(\\alpha,\\beta|x,y) \\]\nThat’s right, we’re looking for the values of \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) that minimize scalar-valued function \\(L(\\alpha, \\beta)\\). Sounds familiar huh?\nTo solve this minimization problem with gradient descent, we can use the following update rule.\n\\[[\\alpha_{t+1}, \\beta_{t+1}] = [\\alpha_{t}, \\beta_{t}] - \\eta \\nabla L(\\alpha_t, \\beta_t | x, y) \\]\nTo get the gradient \\(\\nabla L(\\alpha,\\beta|x,y)\\), we need the partial derivatives of \\(L\\) with respect to \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\). Since \\(L\\) is just a big sum, it’s easy to calculate the derivatives.\n\\[ \\frac{\\partial L(\\alpha, \\beta)}{\\partial \\alpha} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} -2 (y_i - (\\alpha + \\beta x_i)) \\] \\[ \\frac{\\partial L(\\alpha, \\beta)}{\\partial \\beta} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} -2x_i (y_i - (\\alpha + \\beta x_i)) \\]\nGreat! We’ve got everything we need to implement gradient descent to train an ordinary least squares model. Everything except data that is.\n\nToy Data\nLet’s make a friendly little linear dataset where \\(\\alpha=-10\\) and \\(\\beta=2\\), i.e.\n\\[ y = -10 + 2x + \\text{noise}\\]\n\nimport numpy as np \n\nalpha_true = -10\nbeta_true = 2\n\nrng = np.random.default_rng(42)\nx = np.linspace(0, 10, 50)\ny = alpha_true + beta_true*x + rng.normal(0, 1, size=x.shape)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImplementation\nOur implementation will use a function to compute the gradient of the loss function. Since we have two parameters, we’ll use length-2 arrays to hold their values and their partial derivatives. At each iteration, we update the parameter values by subtracting the rescaled partial derivatives.\n\n\n# linear regression using gradient descent \n\ndef gradient_of_loss(parameters, x, y):\n    alpha = parameters[0]\n    beta = parameters[1]\n    partial_alpha = np.mean(-2*(y - (alpha + beta*x)))\n    partial_beta = np.mean(-2*x*(y - (alpha + beta*x)))\n    return np.array([partial_alpha, partial_beta])\n\nlearning_rate = 0.02\nparameters = np.array([0.0, 0.0]) # initial values of alpha and beta\n\nfor _ in range(500):\n    partial_derivatives = gradient_of_loss(parameters, x, y)\n    parameters -= learning_rate * partial_derivatives\n    \nparameters\n\narray([-10.07049616,   2.03559051])\n\n\nWe can see the loss function decreasing throughout the 500 iterations.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd we can visualize the loss function as a contour plot over \\((\\alpha,\\beta)\\) space. The blue points show the trajectory our gradient descent followed as it shimmied from the initial position to the coolest spot in \\((\\alpha, \\beta)\\) space where the loss function is nice and small.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur gradient descent settles in a spot pretty close to \\((-10, 2)\\) in \\((\\alpha,\\beta)\\) space, which gives us the final fitted model below."

If so, that’s great because you already have a sense for the key operations we need when working with tabular data. In their book, R for Data Science, Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham describe five essential operations for manipulating dataframes. I’ve found that these cover the majority of my data transformation tasks to prepare data for analysis, visualization, and modeling.\nI would add that we also need a way to build up more complex transformations by chaining these fundamental operations together sequentially.\nBefore we dive in, here’s the TLDR on the pandas methods that I prefer for accomplishing these tasks, along with their equivalents from SQL and dplyr in R."

You can specify compound expressions using and and or, and you can even check if the column value matches any items in a list.\n\n# compare one column to a value\nflights.query('month == 6')\n\n# compare two column values\nflights.query('arr_delay &gt; dep_delay')\n\n# using arithmetic\nflights.query('arr_delay &gt; 0.5 * air_time')\n\n# using \"and\"\nflights.query('month == 6 and day == 1')\n\n# using \"or\"\nflights.query('origin == \"JFK\" or dest == \"JFK\"')\n\n# column value matching any item in a list\nflights.query('carrier in [\"AA\", \"UA\"]')\n\nYou may have noticed that it seems to be much more popular to filter pandas data frames using boolean indexing. Indeed when I ask my favorite search engine how to filter a pandas dataframe on its values, I find this tutorial, this blog post, various questions on Stack Overflow, and even the pandas documentation, all espousing boolean indexing. Here’s what it looks like.\n\n# canonical boolean indexing\nflights[(flights['carrier'] == \"AA\") & (flights['origin'] == \"JFK\")]\n\n# the equivalent use of query()\nflights.query('carrier == \"AA\" and origin == \"JFK\"')\n\nThere are a few reasons I prefer query() over boolean indexing.\n\nquery() does not require me to type the dataframe name again, whereas boolean indexing requires me to type it every time I wish to refer to a column.\nquery() makes the code easier to read and understand, especially when expressions get complex.\nquery() is more computationally efficient than boolean indexing.\nquery() can safely be used in dot chains, which we’ll see very soon."

Let’s break it down. In the call to assign() the keyword argument speed tells pandas the name of our new column. The business to the right of the = is a inline lambda function that takes the dataframe we passed to assign() and returns the column we want to add.\nI like using x as the lambda argument because its easy to type and it evokes tabular data (think design matrix), which reminds me that it refers to the entire dataframe. We can then access the other columns in our dataframe using the dot like x.other_column.\nIt’s true that you can skip the whole lambda business and refer to the dataframe to which you are assigning directly inside the assign. That might look like this.\nflights.assign(speed = flights.distance / flights.air_time)\nI prefer using a lambda for the following reasons.\n\nIf you gave your dataframe a good name, using the lambda will save you from typing the name every time you want to refer to a column.\nThe lambda makes your code more portable. Since you refer to the dataframe as a generic x, you can reuse this same assignment code on a dataframe with a different name.\nMost importantly, the lambda will allow you to harness the power of dot chaining."

    "text": "Chain transformations together with the dot chain\nOne of the awesome things about pandas is that the object.method() paradigm lets us easily build up complex dataframe transformations from a sequence of method calls. In R, this is effectively accomplished by the pipe %&gt;% operator. For example, suppose we want to look at high-speed flights from JFK to Honolulu, which would require us to query for JFK to Honolulu flights, assign a speed column, and maybe sort on that new speed column.\nWe can say:\n\n# neatly chain method calls together\n(\n    flights\n    .query('origin == \"JFK\"')\n    .query('dest == \"HNL\"')\n    .assign(speed = lambda x: x.distance / x.air_time)\n    .sort_values(by='speed', ascending=False)\n    .query('speed &gt; 8.0')\n)\n\nWe compose the dot chain by wrapping the entire expression in parentheses and indenting each line within. The first line is the name of the dataframe on which we are operating. Each subsequent line has a single method call.\nThere are a few great things about writing the code this way: 1. Readability. It’s easy to scan down the left margin of the code to see what’s happening. The first line gives us our noun (the dataframe) and each subsequent line starts with a verb. You could read this as “take flights then query the rows where origin is JFK, then query for rows where destination is HNL, then assign a new column called speed, then sort the dataframe by speed, then query only for the rows where speed is greater than 8.0. 1. Flexibility - It’s easy to comment out individual lines and re-run the cell. It’s also easy to reorder operations, since only one thing happens on each line. 1. Neatness - We have not polluted our workspace with any intermediate variables, nor have we wasted any mental energy thinking of names for any temporary variables.\nBy default, dot chains do not modify the original dataframe; they just output a temporary result that we can inspect directly in the output. If you want to store the result, or pass it along to another function (e.g. for plotting), you can simply assign the entire dot chain to a variable.\n\n# sotre the output of the dot chain in a new dataframe\nflights_high_speed = (\n    flights\n    .assign(speed = lambda x: x.distance / x.air_time)\n    .query('speed &gt; 8.0')\n)"

This is the primary pattern I use for SQL-style groupby operations in pandas. Specifically it unlocks the following essential functionality you’re used to having in SQL. 1. specify the names of the aggregation columns we create 1. specify which aggregation function to use on which columns 1. compose more complex aggregations such as the proportion of rows meeting some condition 1. aggregate over arbitrary functions of multiple columns\nLet’s check out the departure delay stats for each carrier.\n\n# grouped summary with groupby and apply\n(\n    flights\n    .groupby(['carrier'])\n    .apply(lambda d: pd.Series({\n        'n_flights': len(d),\n        'med_delay': d.dep_delay.median(),\n        'avg_delay': d.dep_delay.mean(),\n    }))\n    .head()\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nn_flights\nmed_delay\navg_delay\n\n\ncarrier\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9E\n1696.0\n-1.0\n17.285967\n\n\nAA\n3188.0\n-2.0\n9.142409\n\n\nAS\n66.0\n-4.5\n5.181818\n\n\nB6\n5376.0\n-1.0\n13.137091\n\n\nDL\n4751.0\n-2.0\n8.529573\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile you might be used to apply() acting over the rows or columns of a dataframe, here we’re calling apply on a grouped dataframe object, so it’s acting over the groups. According to the pandas documentation:\n\nThe function passed to apply must take a dataframe as its first argument and return a dataframe, a series or a scalar. apply will then take care of combining the results back together into a single dataframe or series. apply is therefore a highly flexible grouping method.\n\nWe need to supply apply() with a function that takes each chunk of the grouped dataframe and returns (in our case) a series object with one element for each new aggregation column. Notice that I use a lambda to specify the function we pass to apply()), and that I name its argument d, which reminds me that it’s a dataframe. My lambda returns a pandas series whose index entries specify the new aggregation column names, and whose values constitute the results of the aggregations for each group. Pandas will then stitch everything back together into a lovely dataframe.\nNotice how nice the code looks when we use this pattern. Each aggregation is specified on its own line, which makes it easy to see what aggregation columns we’re creating and allows us to comment, uncomment, and reorder the aggregations without breaking anything.\nHere are some more complex aggregations to illustrate some useful patterns.\n\n# more complex grouped summary\n(\n    flights\n    .groupby(['carrier'])\n    .apply(lambda d: pd.Series({\n        'avg_gain': np.mean(d.dep_delay - d.arr_delay), \n        'pct_delay_gt_30': np.mean(d.dep_delay &gt; 30), \n        'pct_late_dep_early_arr': np.mean((d.dep_delay &gt; 0) & (d.arr_delay &lt; 0)), \n        'avg_arr_given_dep_delay_gt_0': d.query('dep_delay &gt; 0').arr_delay.mean(),\n        'cor_arr_delay_dep_delay': np.corrcoef(d.dep_delay, d.arr_delay)[0,1],\n    }))\n    .head()\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\navg_gain\npct_delay_gt_30\npct_late_dep_early_arr\navg_arr_given_dep_delay_gt_0\ncor_arr_delay_dep_delay\n\n\ncarrier\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9E\n9.247642\n0.196934\n0.110259\n39.086111\n0.932485\n\n\nAA\n7.743726\n0.113237\n0.105395\n30.087165\n0.891013\n\n\nAS\n16.515152\n0.106061\n0.121212\n28.058824\n0.864565\n\n\nB6\n3.411458\n0.160528\n0.084449\n37.306866\n0.914180\n\n\nDL\n7.622816\n0.097874\n0.100821\n30.078029\n0.899327\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s what’s happening.\n\nnp.mean(d.dep_delay - d.arr_delay) aggregates over the difference of two columns.\nnp.mean(d.dep_delay &gt; 30) computes the proportion of rows where the delay is greater than 30 minutes. Generating a boolean series based on some condition and then using mean() to find the proportion comes up all the time.\nnp.mean((d.dep_delay &gt; 0) & (d.arr_delay &lt; 0)) shows that we can compute proportions where conditions on multiple columns are met.\nd.query('dep_delay &gt; 0').arr_delay.mean() computes the average arrival delay on flights where the departure was delayed. Here we first filter each grouped dataframe down to the subset of rows where departure delay is greater than zero using query(), and then we take the mean of the remaining arrival delays.\nnp.corrcoef(d.dep_delay, d.arr_delay)[0,1] computes the correlation coefficient between departure and arrival delays. Remember we can use pretty much any reduction operation to collapse values down to a scalar.\n\nYou might have noticed that the canonical pandas approach for grouped summaries is to use agg(). That works well if you need to apply the same aggregation function on each column in the dataframe, e.g. taking the mean of every column. But because of the kind of data I work with these days, it’s much more common for me to use customized aggregations like those above, so the groupby() apply() idiom works best for me."

Indeed we just spent all that time converting from R and learning python and why the hell do we need yet another API for working with dataframes?\nThat’s a totally fair question.\nSo what happens when we’re working on something in the real world, where datasets get large in a hurry, and we suddenly have a dataframe that no longer fits into memory? We need a way for our computations and datasets to scale across multiple nodes in a distributed system without having to get too fussy about all the distributed compute details.\nEnter PySpark.\nI think it’s fair to think of PySpark as a python package for working with arbitrarily large dataframes, i.e., it’s like pandas but scalable. It’s built on top of Apache Spark, a unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing. PySpark is essentially a way to access the functionality of spark via python code. While there are other high-level interfaces to Spark (such as Java, Scala, and R), for data scientists who are already working extensively with python, PySpark will be the natural interface of choice. PySpark also has great integration with SQL, and it has a companion machine learning library called MLlib that’s more or less a scalable scikit-learn (maybe we can cover it in a future post).\nSo, here’s the plan. First we’re going to get set up to run PySpark locally in a jupyter notebook on our laptop. This is my preferred environment for interactively playing with PySpark and learning the ropes. Then we’re going to get up and running in PySpark as quickly as possible by reviewing the most essential functionality for working with dataframes and comparing it to how we would do things in pandas. Once we’re comfortable running PySpark on the laptop, it’s going to be much easier to jump onto a distributed cluster and run PySpark at scale.\nLet’s do this."

This is an interactive shell where we can easily experiment with PySpark. Feel free to run the example code in this post here in the PySpark shell, or, if you prefer a notebook, read on and we’ll get set up to run PySpark in a jupyter notebook.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhen I tried following this setup on a new Mac, I hit an error about being unable to find the Java Runtime. This stack overflow question lead me to the fix.\n\n\n\n\nThe Spark Session Object\nYou may have noticed that when we launched that PySpark interactive shell, it told us that something called SparkSession was available as 'spark'. So basically, what’s happening here is that when we launch the pyspark shell, it instantiates an object called spark which is an instance of class pyspark.sql.session.SparkSession. The spark session object is going to be our entry point for all kinds of PySpark functionality, i.e., we’re going to be saying things like spark.this() and spark.that() to make stuff happen.\nThe PySpark interactive shell is kind enough to instantiate one of these spark session objects for us automatically. However, when we’re using another interface to PySpark (like say a jupyter notebook running a python kernal), we’ll have to make a spark session object for ourselves.\n\n\nCreate a PySpark Session in a Jupyter Notebook\nThere are a few ways to run PySpark in jupyter which you can read about here.\nFor derping around with PySpark on your laptop, I think the best way is to instantiate a spark session from a jupyter notebook running on a regular python kernel. The method we’ll use involves running a standard jupyter notebook session with a python kernal and using the findspark package to initialize the spark session. So, first install the findspark package.\nconda install -c conda-forge findspark\nLaunch jupyter as usual.\njupyter notebook\nGo ahead and fire up a new notebook using a regular python 3 kernal. Once you land inside the notebook, there are a couple things we need to do to get a spark session instantiated. You can think of this as boilerplate code that we need to run in the first cell of a notebook where we’re going to use PySpark.\n\nimport pyspark\nimport findspark\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\n\nfindspark.init()\nspark = SparkSession.builder.appName('My Spark App').getOrCreate()\n\nFirst we’re running findspark’s init() method to find our Spark installation. If you run into errors here, make sure you got the SPARK_HOME environment variable correctly set in the install instructions above. Then we instantiate a spark session as spark. Once you run this, you’re ready to rock and roll with PySpark in your jupyter notebook.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSpark provides a handy web UI that you can use for monitoring and debugging. Once you instantiate the spark session You can open the UI in your web browser at http://localhost:4040/jobs/."

There are a couple of key concepts that will help explain these idiosyncracies.\nImmutability - Pyspark RDD’s and dataframes are immutable. This means that if you change an object, e.g. by adding a column to a dataframe, PySpark returns a reference to a new dataframe; it does not modify the existing dataframe. This is kind of nice, because we don’t have to worry about that whole view versus copy nonsense that happens in pandas.\nLazy Evaluation - Lazy evaluation means that when we start manipulating a dataframe, PySpark won’t actually perform any of the computations until we explicitly ask for the result. This is nice because it potentially allows PySpark to do fancy optimizations before executing a sequence of operations. It’s also confusing at first, because PySpark will seem to blaze through complex operations and then take forever to print a few rows of the dataframe."

Remember that show() will cause PySpark to execute any operations that it’s been lazily waiting to evaluate, so sometimes it can take a while to run.\n\n# show the first few rows of the dataframe\npyspark_df.show(5)\n\n+----------+----+------+------+---+------+----+\n|total_bill| tip|   sex|smoker|day|  time|size|\n+----------+----+------+------+---+------+----+\n|     16.99|1.01|Female|    No|Sun|Dinner|   2|\n|     10.34|1.66|  Male|    No|Sun|Dinner|   3|\n|     21.01| 3.5|  Male|    No|Sun|Dinner|   3|\n|     23.68|3.31|  Male|    No|Sun|Dinner|   2|\n|     24.59|3.61|Female|    No|Sun|Dinner|   4|\n+----------+----+------+------+---+------+----+\nonly showing top 5 rows\n\n\n\n\n[Stage 0:&gt;                                                          (0 + 1) / 1]\n\n                                                                                \n\n\nWe thus encounter our first rude awakening. PySpark’s default representation of dataframes in the notebook isn’t as pretty as that of pandas. But no one ever said it would be pretty, they just said it would be scalable.\nYou can also use the printSchema() method for a nice vertical representation of the schema.\n\n# show the dataframe schema\npyspark_df.printSchema()\n\nroot\n |-- total_bill: double (nullable = true)\n |-- tip: double (nullable = true)\n |-- sex: string (nullable = true)\n |-- smoker: string (nullable = true)\n |-- day: string (nullable = true)\n |-- time: string (nullable = true)\n |-- size: long (nullable = true)\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect columns by name\nYou can select specific columns from a dataframe using the select() method. You can pass either a list of names, or pass names as arguments.\n\n# select some of the columns\npyspark_df.select('total_bill', 'tip')\n\n# select columns in a list\npyspark_df.select(['day', 'time', 'total_bill'])\n\n\n\nFilter rows based on column values\nAnalogous to the WHERE clause in SQL, and the query() method in pandas, PySpark provides a filter() method which returns only the rows that meet the specified conditions. Its argument is a string specifying the condition to be met for rows to be included in the result. You specify the condition as an expression involving the column names and comparison operators like &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=, == (equal), and ~= (not equal). You can specify compound expressions using and and or, and you can even do a SQL-like in to check if the column value matches any items in a list.\n\n## compare a column to a value\npyspark_df.filter('total_bill &gt; 20')\n\n# compare two columns with arithmetic\npyspark_df.filter('tip &gt; 0.15 * total_bill')\n\n# check equality with a string value\npyspark_df.filter('sex == \"Male\"')\n\n# check equality with any of several possible values\npyspark_df.filter('day in (\"Sat\", \"Sun\")')\n\n# use \"and\" \npyspark_df.filter('day == \"Fri\" and time == \"Lunch\"')\n\nIf you’re into boolean indexing with the brackets, PySpark does support that too, but I encourage you to use filter() instead. Check out my rant about why you shouldn’t use boolean indexing for the details. The TLDR is that filter() requires less typing, makes your code more readable and portable, and it allows you to chain method calls together using dot chains.\nHere’s the boolean indexing equivalent of the last example from above.\n\n# using boolean indexing\npyspark_df[(pyspark_df.day == 'Fri') & (pyspark_df.time == 'Lunch')]\n\nI know, it looks horrendous, but not as horrendous as the error message you’ll get if you forget the parentheses.\n\n\nAdd new columns to a dataframe\nYou can add new columns which are functions of the existing columns with the withColumn() method.\n\nimport pyspark.sql.functions as f\n\n# add a new column using col() to reference other columns\npyspark_df.withColumn('tip_percent', f.col('tip') / f.col('total_bill'))\n\nNotice that we’ve imported the pyspark.sql.functions module. This module contains lots of useful functions that we’ll be using all over the place, so it’s probably a good idea to go ahead and import it whenever you’re using PySpark. BTW, it seems like folks usually import this module as f or F. In this example we’re using the col() function, which allows us to refer to columns in our dataframe using string representations of the column names.\nYou could also achieve the same result using the dot to reference the other columns, but this requires us to type the dataframe name over and over again, which makes it harder to reuse this code on different dataframes or in dot chains.\n\n# add a new column using the dot to reference other columns (less recommended)\npyspark_df.withColumn('tip_percent', pyspark_df.tip / pyspark_df.total_bill)\n\nIf you want to apply numerical transformations like exponents or logs, use the built-in functions in the pyspark.sql.functions module.\n\n# log \npyspark_df.withColumn('log_bill', f.log(f.col('total_bill')))\n\n# exponent\npyspark_df.withColumn('bill_squared', f.pow(f.col('total_bill'), 2))\n\nYou can implement conditional assignment like SQL’s CASE WHEN construct using the when() function and the otherwise() method.\n\n# conditional assignment (like CASE WHEN)\npyspark_df.withColumn('is_male', f.when(f.col('sex') == 'Male', True).otherwise(False))\n\n# using multiple when conditions and values\npyspark_df.withColumn('bill_size', \n    f.when(f.col('total_bill') &lt; 10, 'small')\n    .when(f.col('total_bill') &lt; 20, 'medium')\n    .otherwise('large')\n)\n\nRemember that since PySpark dataframes are immutable, calling withColumns() on a dataframe returns a new dataframe. If you want to persist the result, you’ll need to make an assignment.\npyspark_df = pyspark_df.withColumns(...)\n\n\nGroup by and aggregate\nPySpark provides a groupBy() method similar to the pandas groupby(). Just like in pandas, we can call methods like count() and mean() on our grouped dataframe, and we also have a more flexible agg() method that allows us to specify column-aggregation mappings.\n\n\n# group by and count\npyspark_df.groupBy('time').count().show()\n\n+------+-----+\n|  time|count|\n+------+-----+\n|Dinner|  176|\n| Lunch|   68|\n+------+-----+\n\n\n\n\n\n# group by and specify column-aggregation mappings with agg()\npyspark_df.groupBy('time').agg({'total_bill': 'mean', 'tip': 'max'}).show()\n\n+------+--------+------------------+\n|  time|max(tip)|   avg(total_bill)|\n+------+--------+------------------+\n|Dinner|    10.0| 20.79715909090909|\n| Lunch|     6.7|17.168676470588235|\n+------+--------+------------------+\n\n\n\nIf you want to get fancier with your aggregations, it might just be easier to express them using hive syntax. Read on to find out how.\n\n\nRun Hive SQL on dataframes\nOne of the mind-blowing features of PySpark is that it allows you to write hive SQL queries on your dataframes. To take a PySpark dataframe into the SQL world, use the createOrReplaceTempView() method. This method takes one string argument which will be the dataframes name in the SQL world. Then you can use spark.sql() to run a query. The result is returned as a PySpark dataframe.\n\n\n# put pyspark dataframe in SQL world and query it\npyspark_df.createOrReplaceTempView('tips')\nspark.sql('select * from tips').show(5)\n\n+----------+----+------+------+---+------+----+\n|total_bill| tip|   sex|smoker|day|  time|size|\n+----------+----+------+------+---+------+----+\n|     16.99|1.01|Female|    No|Sun|Dinner|   2|\n|     10.34|1.66|  Male|    No|Sun|Dinner|   3|\n|     21.01| 3.5|  Male|    No|Sun|Dinner|   3|\n|     23.68|3.31|  Male|    No|Sun|Dinner|   2|\n|     24.59|3.61|Female|    No|Sun|Dinner|   4|\n+----------+----+------+------+---+------+----+\nonly showing top 5 rows\n\n\n\nThis is awesome for a couple of reasons. First, it allows us to easily express any transformations in hive syntax. If you’re like me and you’ve already been using hive, this will dramatically reduce the PySpark learning curve, because when in doubt, you can always bump a dataframe into the SQL world and simply use hive to do what you need. Second, if you have a hive deployment, PySpark’s SQL world also has access to all of your hive tables. This means you can write queries involving both hive tables and your PySpark dataframes. It also means you can run hive commands, like inserting into a table, directly from PySpark.\nLet’s do some aggregations that might be a little trickier to do using the PySpark built-in functions.\n\n\n# run hive query and save result to dataframe\ntip_stats_by_time = spark.sql(\"\"\"\n    select\n        time\n        , count(*) as n \n        , avg(tip) as avg_tip\n        , percentile_approx(tip, 0.5) as med_tip\n        , avg(case when tip &gt; 3 then 1 else 0 end) as pct_tip_gt_3\n    from \n        tips\n    group by 1\n\"\"\")\n\ntip_stats_by_time.show()\n\n+------+---+------------------+-------+-------------------+\n|  time|  n|           avg_tip|med_tip|       pct_tip_gt_3|\n+------+---+------------------+-------+-------------------+\n|Dinner|176| 3.102670454545455|    3.0|0.44886363636363635|\n| Lunch| 68|2.7280882352941176|    2.2|0.27941176470588236|\n+------+---+------------------+-------+-------------------+"

Of course, if your PySpark dataframe is huge, you wouldn’t want to use toPandas() directly, because PySpark will attempt to read the entire contents of its huge dataframe into memory.

    "text": "A weathered tree reaches toward the sea at Playa Mal País\nWell, dear reader, it’s that time again, time for us to do a seemingly unnecessary scratch build of a popular algorithm that most people would simply import from the library without a second thought. But readers of this blog are not most people. Of course you know that when we do scratch builds, it’s not for the hell of it, it’s for the purpose of demystification. To that end, today we are going to implement XGBoost from scratch in python, using only numpy and pandas.\nSpecifically we’re going to implement the core statistical learning algorithm of XGBoost, including most of the key hyperparameters and their functionality. Our implementation will also support user-defined custom objective functions, meaning that it can perform regression, classification, and whatever exotic learning tasks you can dream up, as long as you can write down a twice-differentiable objective function. We’ll refrain from implementing some simple features like column subsampling which will be left to you, gentle reader, as exercises. In terms of tree methods, we’re going to implement the exact tree-splitting algorithm, leaving the sparsity-aware method (used to handle missing feature values) and the approximate method (used for scalability) as exercises or maybe topics for future posts.\nAs always, if something is unclear, try backtracking through the previous posts on gradient boosting and decision trees to clarify your intuition. We’ve already built up all the statistical and computational background needed to make sense of this scratch build. Here are the most important prerequisite posts:\nGreat, let’s do this."

    "text": "The XGBoost Model Class\nWe begin with the user-facing API for our model, a class called XGBoostModel which will implement gradient boosting and prediction. To be more consistent with the XGBoost library, we’ll pass hyperparameters to our model in a parameter dictionary, so our init method is going to pull relevant parameters out of the dictionary and set them as object attributes. Note the use of python’s defaultdict so we don’t have to worry about handling key errors if we try to access a parameter that the user didn’t set in the dictionary.\n\nimport math\nimport numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\n\nclass XGBoostModel():\n    '''XGBoost from Scratch\n    '''\n    \n    def __init__(self, params, random_seed=None):\n        self.params = defaultdict(lambda: None, params)\n        self.subsample = self.params['subsample'] \\\n            if self.params['subsample'] else 1.0\n        self.learning_rate = self.params['learning_rate'] \\\n            if self.params['learning_rate'] else 0.3\n        self.base_prediction = self.params['base_score'] \\\n            if self.params['base_score'] else 0.5\n        self.max_depth = self.params['max_depth'] \\\n            if self.params['max_depth'] else 5\n        self.rng = np.random.default_rng(seed=random_seed)\n\nThe fit method, based on our classic GBM, takes a feature dataframe, a target vector, the objective function, and the number of boosting rounds as arguments. The user-supplied objective function should be an object with loss, gradient, and hessian methods, each of which takes a target vector and a prediction vector as input; the loss method should return a scalar loss score, the gradient method should return a vector of gradients, and the hessian method should return a vector of hessians.\nIn contrast to boosting in the classic GBM, instead of computing residuals between the current predictions and the target, we compute gradients and hessians of the loss function with respect to the current predictions, and instead of predicting residuals with a decision tree, we fit a special XGBoost tree booster (which we’ll implement in a moment) using the gradients and hessians. I’ve also added row subsampling by drawing a random subset of instance indices and passing them to the tree booster during each boosting round. The rest of the fit method is the same as the classic GBM, and the predict method is identical too.\n\ndef fit(self, X, y, objective, num_boost_round, verbose=False):\n    current_predictions = self.base_prediction * np.ones(shape=y.shape)\n    self.boosters = []\n    for i in range(num_boost_round):\n        gradients = objective.gradient(y, current_predictions)\n        hessians = objective.hessian(y, current_predictions)\n        sample_idxs = None if self.subsample == 1.0 \\\n            else self.rng.choice(len(y), \n                                 size=math.floor(self.subsample*len(y)), \n                                 replace=False)\n        booster = TreeBooster(X, gradients, hessians, \n                              self.params, self.max_depth, sample_idxs)\n        current_predictions += self.learning_rate * booster.predict(X)\n        self.boosters.append(booster)\n        if verbose: \n            print(f'[{i}] train loss = {objective.loss(y, current_predictions)}')\n            \ndef predict(self, X):\n    return (self.base_prediction + self.learning_rate \n            * np.sum([booster.predict(X) for booster in self.boosters], axis=0))\n\nXGBoostModel.fit = fit\nXGBoostModel.predict = predict            \n\nAll we have to do now is implement the tree booster."

    "text": "The XGBoost Tree Booster\nThe XGBoost tree booster is a modified version of the decision tree that we built in the decision tree from scratch post. Like the decision tree, we recursively build a binary tree structure by finding the best split rule for each node in the tree. The main difference is the criterion for evaluating splits and the way that we define a leaf’s predicted value. Instead of being functions of the target values of the instances in each node, the criterion and predicted values are functions of the instance gradients and hessians. Thus we need only make a couple of modifications to our previous decision tree implementation to create the XGBoost tree booster.\n\nInitialization and Inserting Child Nodes\nMost of the init method is just parsing the parameter dictionary to assign parameters as object attributes. The one notable difference from our decision tree is in the way we define the node’s predicted value. We define self.value according to equation 5 of the XGBoost paper, a simple function of the gradient and hessian values of the instances in the current node. Of course the init also goes on to build the tree via the maybe insert child nodes method. This method is nearly identical to the one we implemented for our decision tree.

    "text": "Classification and Regression Trees\nA Decision tree is a type of statistical model that takes features or covariates as input and yields a prediction as output. The idea of the decision tree as a statistical learning tool traces back to a monograph published in 1984 by Breiman, Freidman, Olshen, and Stone called “Classification and Regression Trees” (a.k.a. CART). As the name suggests, trees come in two main varieties: classification trees which predict discrete class labels (e.g. DecisionTreeClassifier) and regression trees which predict numeric values (e.g. DecisionTreeRegressor).\nAs I mentioned earlier, tree models are not very powerful learners on their own. You might find that an individual tree model is useful for creating a simple and highly interpretable model in specific situations, but in general, trees tend to shine most as building blocks in more complex algorithms. These composite models are called ensembles, and the most important tree ensembles are random forest and gradient boosted trees. While random forest uses either regression or classification trees depending on the type of target, gradient boosting can use regression trees to solve both classification and regression tasks."

    "text": "Regression Tree in Action\nLet’s have a closer look at regression trees by training one on the diabetes dataset from scikit learn. According to the documentation:\n\nTen baseline variables, age, sex, body mass index, average blood pressure, and six blood serum measurements were obtained for each of n = 442 diabetes patients, as well as the response of interest, a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline.\n\nFirst we load the data. To make our lives easier, we’ll just use two features: average blood pressure (bp) and the first blood serum measurement (s1) to predict the target. I’ll rescale the features to make the values easier for me to read, but it won’t affect our tree–more on that later.\n\nimport numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\ncolor_palette = \"viridis\"\n\n\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_diabetes\n\nX, y = load_diabetes(as_frame=True, return_X_y=True)\n\nX = 100 * X[['bp', 's1']]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s grow a tree to predict the target given values of blood pressure and blood serum.\n\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor\n\ntree = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=2)\ntree.fit(X,y);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo make predictions using our fitted tree, we start at the root node (which is at the top), and we work our way down moving left if our feature is less than the split threshold and to the right if it’s greater than the split threshold. For example let’s predict the target for a new case with bp= 1 and s1 = 5. Since our blood pressure of 1 is less than 2.359, we move to the left child node. Here, since our serum of 5 is greater than the threshold at 0.875, we move to the right child node. This node has no further children, and thus we return its predicted value of 155.343.\n\ntree.predict(pd.DataFrame({'bp': 1, 's1': 5}, index=[0]))\n\narray([155.34313725])\n\n\nLet’s overlay these splits on our feature scatterplot to see how the tree has partitioned the feature space.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tree has managed to carve out regions of feature space where the target values tend to be similar within each region, e.g. we have low target values in the bottom left partition and high target values in the far right region.\nLet’s take a look at the regression surface predicted by our tree. Since the tree predicts the exact same value for all instances in a given partition, the surface has only four distinct values.\n\n\n\n\n\nFabulous, now that we’ve seen a tree in action, let’s talk about trees’ key strengths and weaknesses."

    "section": "Why trees are awesome",
    "text": "Why trees are awesome\nTrees are awesome because they are easy to use, and trees are easy to use because they are robust, require minimal data preprocessing, and can learn complex relationships without user intervention.\n\nFeature Scaling\nTrees owe their minimal data preprocessing requirements and their robustness to the fact that split finding is controlled by the sort order of the input feature values, rather than the values themselves. This means that trees are invariant to the scaling of input features, which in turn means that we don’t need to fuss around with carefully rescaling all the numeric features before fitting a tree. It also means that trees tend to work well even if features are highly skewed or contain outliers.\n\n\nCategoricals\nSince trees just split data based on numeric feature values, we can easily handle most categorical features by using integer encoding. For example we might encode a size feature with small = 1, medium = 2, and large = 3. This works particularly well with ordered categories, because partitioning is consistent with the category semantics. It can also work well even if the categories have no order, because with enough splits a tree can carve each category into its own partition.\n\n\nMissing Values\nIt’s worth calling out that different implementations of the decision tree handle missing feature values in different ways. Notably, scikit-learn handles them by throwing an error and telling you not to pull such shenanigans.\nValueError: Input contains NaN, infinity or a value too large for dtype('float32').\nOn the other hand, XGBoost supports an elegant way to make use of missing values, which we will discuss more in a later post.\n\n\nInteractions\nFeature interactions can also be learned automatically. An interaction means that the effect of one feature on the target differs depending on the value of another feature. For example, the effect of some drug may depend on whether or not the patient exercises. After a tree splits on exercise, it can naturally learn the correct drug effects for both exercisers and non-exercisers. This intuition extends to higher-order interactions as well, as long as the tree has enough splits to parse the relationships.\n\n\nFeature Selection\nBecause trees choose the best feature and threshold value at each split, they essentially perform automatic feature selection. This is great because even if we throw a lot of irrelevant features at a decision tree, it will simply tend not to use them for splits. Similarly, if two or more features are highly correlated or even redundant, the tree will simply choose one or the other when making each split; having both in the model will not cause catastrophic instability as it could in a linear model.\n\n\nFeature-Target Relationship\nFinally, it is possible for trees to discover complex nonlinear feature-target relationships without the need for user-specification of the relationships. This is because trees use local piecewise constant approximations without making any parametric assumptions. With enough splits, the tree can approximate arbitrary feature-target relationships."

    "section": "Why trees are not so awesome",
    "text": "Why trees are not so awesome\nThe main weakness of the decision tree is that, on its own, it tends to have poor predictive performance compared to other algorithms. The main reasons for this are the tendency to overfit and prediction quantization issues.\n\nOverfitting\nIf we grow a decision tree until each leaf has exactly one instance in it, we will have simply memorized the training data, and our model will not generalize well. Basically the only defense against overfitting is to reduce the number of leaf nodes in the tree, either by using hyperparameters to stop splitting earlier or by removing certain leaf nodes after growing a deep tree. The problem here is that some of the benefits of trees, like ability to approximate arbitrary target patterns and ability to learn interaction effects, depend on having enough splits for the task. We can sometimes find ourselves in a situation where we cannot learn these complex relationships without overfitting the tree.\n\n\nQuantization\nBecause regression trees use piecewise constant functions to approximate the target, prediction accuracy can deteriorate near split boundaries. For example, if the target is increasing with the feature, a tree might tend to overpredict the target on the left side of split boundaries and overpredict on the right side of split boundaries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtrapolation\nBecause they are trained by partitioning the feature space in a training dataset, trees cannot intelligently extrapolate beyond the data on which they are trained. For example if we query a tree for predictions beyond the greatest feature value encountered in training, it will just return the prediction corresponding to the largest in-sample feature values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dark Side of Convenience\nFinally, there is always a price to pay for convenience. While trees can work well even with a messy dataset containing outliers, redundant features, and thoughtlessly encoded categoricals, we will rarely achieve the best performance under these conditions. Taking the time to deal with outliers, removing redundant information, purposefully choosing appropriate categorical encodings, and building an understanding of the data will often lead to much better results."

    "text": "How ensembling makes trees shine\nWe can go a long way toward addressing the issues of overfitting and prediction quantization by using trees as building blocks in larger algorithms called tree ensembles, the most popular examples being random forest and gradient boosted trees. A tree ensemble is a collection of different individual tree models whose predictions are averaged to generate an overall prediction.\nEnsembling helps address overfitting because even if each individual tree is overfitted, the average of their individual noisy predictions will tend to be more stable. Think of it in terms of the bias variance tradeoff, where bias refers to a model’s failure to capture certain patterns and variance refers to how different a model prediction would be if the model were trained on a different sample of training data. Since the ensemble is averaging over the predictions of all the individual models, training it on a different sample of training data would change the individual models predictions, but their overall average prediction will tend to remain stable. Thus, ensembling helps reduce the effects of overfitting by reducing model variance without increasing bias.\nEnsembling also helps address prediction quantization issues. While each individual tree’s predictions might express large jumps in the regression surface, averaging many different trees’ predictions together effectively generates a surface with more partitions and smaller jumps between them. This provides a smoother approximation of the feature-target relationship."

The name will have no effect on your website’s name or URL, so don’t think too hard. The quarto documentation calls it myblog, so we’ll one-up them and call ours pirate-ninja-blog. Run the following command to create it in the current directory.\nquarto create-project pirate-ninja-blog --type website:blog\nThat command creates a directory called pirate-ninja-blog containing everything you need to render your new blog. You can preview your website by running\nquarto preview pirate-ninja-blog\nYour local website will open in a new browser window. As you edit various aspects of your blog, the preview will update with your changes. This preview feature is so simple and so great.\n\n\n\nPreviewing your blog with quarto preview command\n\n\n\n\nSet up a git repo\nChange into your project directory and we’ll start setting up your git repo.\ncd pirate-ninja-blog\ninitialize a new git repo.\ngit init -b main\nThe _site/ directory is where quarto puts the rendered output files, so you’ll want to ignore it in git. I also like to just ignore any hidden files too, so add the following to your .gitignore file.\n\n\n.gitignore\n\n/.quarto/\n/_site/\n.*\n\nFor now we’ll just stage the .gitignore file for the initial commit. Eventually you’ll want to commit the other files in your project too, either now or later as you edit them.\ngit add .gitignore \ngit commit -m \"Initial commit.\"\nThen follow GitHub’s instructions to add the local repo to GitHub using git. Basically just create a new blank repo on GitHub’s website, copy the remote repository url, then add the remote repo url to your local git repo.\ngit remote add origin &lt;REMOTE_URL&gt;\nThen you’ll be able to push any commits you make to your remote repository on GitHub by saying git push."

    "text": "Understand the components of a Quarto blog\n\nContents of the quarto project directory\nLet’s have a quick look at what quarto put inside of the project directory.\n_quarto.yml\nabout.qmd\nindex.qmd\nprofile.jpg\nposts\nstyles.css\n_site\n\nQuarto uses yaml files to specify configurations. The _quarto.yml file specifies project-wide configurations.\nQuarto’s markdown file type uses extension qmd``. Each qmd file will correspond to a page in our website.index.qmdis the homepage andabout.qmd` is the About page.\nprofile.jpg is an image that is included on the about page.\nstyles.css defines css styles for the website.\nposts is a directory where we can put qmd and other documents which will be rendered into blog posts.\nposts/_metadata.yml contains configurations that apply to all documents in the posts directory.\n_site is a directory that contains the rendered website. Whereas all the other files and directories constitute the source code for our blog, _site is the rendered output, i.e. the website itself.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at these components and start to make the blog yours.\n\n\nProject-wide Configurations\nThe _quarto.yml file controls project-wide configurations, website options, and HTML document options. Options in this file are specified in yaml in a key/value structure with three top level keys: project, website, and format. The quarto website options documentation has the full list of options that you can set here. It will be very helpful to take a look at some example _quarto.yml files in the wild, such as the one from quarto.org or even the one from this blog.\nUnder the website key, go ahead and set the title and description for your blog.\nwebsite:\n  title: \"Pirate Ninja Blog\"\n  description: \"A blog about pirates, ninjas, and other things\"\nYou can also customize your navbar which is visible at the top of all pages on your site. Also go ahead and set your github and twitter urls for the icons in the navbar.\nUnder the format key, you can also try changing the HTML theme to one of the other 25 built-in themes.\n\n\nThe About Page\nThe about.qmd file defines an About page for the blog. Go ahead and fill in your details in the about.qmd file; you can also replace the profile.jpg file with your own image. Have a look at the quarto documentation on About pages to explore more functionality. Notably, you can change the template option to change the page layout.\n\n\nThe Homepage\nThe index.qmd file defines the landing page for your website. It is a listing page which shows links to all the pages in the posts directory. For now we don’t need to change anything here.\n\n\nThe posts/ directory\nThe posts directory contains all your blog posts. There aren’t really requirements for subdirectory structure inside the posts directory, but it’s a best practice to create a new subdirectory for each new blog post. This just helps keep auxillary files like images or conda environment files organized. Out of the box, the posts directory looks like this.\nposts\n├── _metadata.yml\n├── post-with-code\n│   ├── image.jpg\n│   └── index.qmd\n└── welcome\n    ├── index.qmd\n    └── thumbnail.jpg\nThere are two reasons we want to be deliberate about how we organize and name things in the posts directory. First, the vast majority of our blog’s content will live here, so we don’t want it to be a big confusing mess. Second, the directory sstructure and file naming will be reflected in the URLs to our blog posts; if you prefer tidy-looking URLs, and I know you do, then you want to use tidy directory and file names in the posts directory.\nYou can check how the URLs look by navigating to one of the pre-populated posts in the site preview in your browser. For instance, the welcome post’s URL would be\nhttps://example.com/posts/welcome/\nWhen quarto renders the qmd file at posts/welcome/index.qmd it creates an output document in the website at posts/welcome/index.html. In fact the full URL to the post is,\nhttps://example.com/posts/welcome/index.html\nbut the browser knows if you give it a URL with a path ending in a /, then it should look for the index.html file inside that directory.\nSo I think the best practice here is to name your new post subdirectory with the title of the post in all lower case with dashes for spaces, e.g. post-with-code. Then to force all output pages to be called index.html, you can set the output-file key in the posts/_metadata.yml file like this.\n\n\nposts/_metadata.yml\n\noutput-file: index.html\n\nNote that alternative naming conventions are possible; notably you might want to prefix each post name with the date in yyyy-mm-dd format, so the post subdirectories sort temporally and look nice in a list. That’s the convention used in Quarto’s own blog at quarto.org, As long as you keep everything for a given post inside its subdirectory, you should be good to go with nice-looking URLs."

    "text": "Authoring posts with jupyter\n\nCreating a new post\nIt turns out that quarto will render not only .qmd files, but also .ipynb files in the posts directory. So let’s create a new blog post from a notebook.\nI think it’s a best practice to write draft posts in their own git branches, that way if you need to deploy some kind of hotfix to main while you’re drafting a post, you won’t have to deploy a half-written post livin on the main branch. To start a new post, create a new development branch, change into the posts directory, create a new subdirectory with your preferred naming convention, change into that new directory, and fire up jupyter.\ngit checkout -b new-post\ncd posts\nmkdir new-post\ncd new-post\njupyter notebook\nNow create a new notebook from the jupyter UI. In order for quarto to recognize the document, the first cell of the notebook must be a raw text cell (press r in command mode to change a cell to raw text), and it must contain the document’s yaml front matter. You can use the following as a frontmatter template.\n---\ntitle: New Post\ndate: 2023-07-12\ndescription: A nice new post\ncategories: [nonsense, code]\n---\nNow to preview your post, open a new terminal, change into your blog’s project directory and run the quarto preview command. You’ll see a link to the new post in the listing on the homepage. I usually like to have the preview open in a browser while I’m editing the jupyter notebook, just to make sure things look the way I want in the rendered output. From here you can keep editing the notebook, and the preview will update in the browser dynamically.\n\n\nMarkdown and code cells\nFrom here you can put text in markdown cells and you can write code in code cells. Let’s add a markdown cell with some markdown formatting.\n## A nice heading\n\nHere is some lovely text and an equation.\n\n$$ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $$\n\nHere's a list.\n\n- a link to an [external website](https://quarto.org).\n- a link to [another post in this blog](/posts/welcome/index.qmd).\nThis markdown will be rendered into the HTML page for the post. The last line in the above cell demonstrates the best practice for using relative urls to link to other resources within your website. Instead of providing the full url in the parentheses, just give the path to the qmd or ipynb file that you want to link to. Note that paths need to start with the / at the root of the quarto project, since without it, quarto will try to resolve paths relative to the location of the current document instead of the root of the project.\nThen create a code cell with some code. Try something like this.\nprint('Hello, Quarto!')\nBy default, both code and cell output will be rendered into the HTML output. So far our jupyter notebook looks like this.\n\n\n\nView of a new post being written in jupyter notebook\n\n\nBack in the browser window running your blog preview, you can see the rendered page of the new post.\n\n\n\nView of the preview of the rendered post\n\n\n\n\nFigures\nLet’s add a figure to our post. Add a new code cell with the following code.\n# | fig-cap: This is my lovely line plot\n# | fig-alt: A line plot extending up and to the right\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nx = np.arange(10)\ny = 2 * x + 1\nplt.plot(x, y);\nNotice a couple of important details. First I placed a semicolon at the end of the last line. That supresses the [&lt;matplotlib.lines.Line2D at 0x1111d00a0&gt;] text output, which would otherwise show up in your blog post too.\nSecond, I added a couple of special comments at the top of the cell. Quarto allows you to specify numerous code execution options, designated by the # | prefix, to control the behavior and appearance of the code and output at a cell level. I set two keys here, fig-cap and fig-alt which respectively set the figure caption text and the image alt tag text. The fig-alt key is particularly important to set on all your figures because it provides the non-visual description for screenreader users reading your post. The alt tag should be a simple description of what the plot is and possibly what it shows or means. Be a friend of the blind and visually impaired community and set fig-alt on all of your figures.\n\n\nVersion control\nAs you edit your new post, go ahead and commit your changes on your development branch. Once you’ve finished your new post, you can merge it into main like this.\ngit checkout main\ngit merge new-post\nThen you can push to GitHub by running git push. You should also be sure to run a final quarto preview to check that everything looks good before publishing to the web."

    "text": "Publishing your blog to the web\n\nHosting with GitHub Pages\nIt’s likely that the easiest (read best) option for you is to host your blog on GitHub Pages. This is because GitHub pages is free, and since you already have your blog’s source code checked into a remote repository at GitHub, it’s very easy to set up. Quarto’s documentation on publishing to GitHub Pages outlines three ways to publish your website, but I recommend their option 2, using the quarto publish command. Once you set up your gh-pages branch as described in the documentation, you simply run quarto publish at the command line and your updates are deployed to your website.\n\n\nSetting up your domain name\nBy default, if you choose to host with GitHub Pages, your website will be published to a url in the form https://username.github.io/reponame/. You can certainly do this; for example Jake VanderPlas’s awesome blog Pythonic Perambulations lives at http://jakevdp.github.io.\nBut, like me, you might want to get your own custom domain by buying, or really renting, one from a registrar. I use Namecheap. If you decide to go for a custom domain, refer to GitHub’s documentation on custom domains. You’ll also need to point your domain registrar to the IP address where GitHub Pages is hosting your website. For an example of how to do this at Namecheap, see Namecheap’s documentation about GitHub Pages\nWhether you decide to use the standard github.io domain or your own custom domain, be sure to set the site-url key in your _quarto.yml file to ensure other quarto functionality works correctly. For example\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nwebsite:\n  site-url: https://example.com/\n\nEdit: I found that after upgrading to quarto 1.3, using quarto publish to publish from the gh-pages branch obliterates the CNAME file that is created when you set a custom domain in your repository settings &gt; Pages &gt; Custom Domain. That breaks the mapping from your custom domain to your published website. See this disscussion thread for details. The fix is to manually create a CNAME file in the root of your project, and include it in the rendered website using the resources option under the project key in _quarto.yml. The CNAME file should just contain your custom domain, excluding any https://.\n\n\nCNAME\n\nexample.com\n\nWith the CNAME file in the root of your quarto project, you can then include it in the rendered output.\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nproject:\n  resources:\n    - CNAME"

    "section": "Keep in touch with your readers",
    "text": "Keep in touch with your readers\n\nRSS Feed\nThe RSS feed is handy for syndicating your posts to feed readers, other websites, and to your email subscribers. As described in quarto’s documentation on RSS feeds, you can automatically generate an RSS feed for your blog by first setting the value of site-url under the website key in _quarto.yml, and then setting feed: true under the listing key in the frontmatter of index.qmd. This will generate an RSS feed in the root of your website called index.xml. Once you have an RSS feed, go ahead and submit it to Python-Bloggers to have your work syndicated to a wider audience and to strengthen our little community of independent data science blogs.\n\n\nEmail Subscriptions\nThe idea here is to have a form field on your website where readers can input their email address to be added to your mailing list. Quarto’s documentation on subscriptions describes how to set up a subscribe box on your blog using MailChimp, so we won’t repeat it here. Once you have some subscribers, you can send them updates whenever you write a new post. You could do this manually or, in my case, set up an automation through MailChimp which uses your RSS feed to send out email updates to the list about new posts.\n\n\nComments\nQuarto has build-in support for three different comment systems: hypothesis, utterances, and giscus. The good news is that these are all free to use, easy to set up, and AFAIK do not engage in any sketchy tracking activities. The bad news is that none of them are ideal because they all require the user to create an account and login to leave a comment. We want to encourage readers to comment, so we don’t want them to have to create accounts or deal with passwords or pick all the squares with bicycles or any such nonsense, just to leave a little comment. To that end, I’ve actually been working on self-hosted login-free comments for this blog using isso, but it’s a bit more involved than these built-in solutions, so we’ll have to discuss it at length in a future post.\nIf you prefer an easy, out-of-the-box solution, I can recommend utterances, which uses GitHub issues to store comments for each post. I used utterances for comments on the first jekyll-based incarnation of this blog; you can still see the utterances comments on posts before this one. Go check out the Quarto documentation on comments to see how to set up utterances in your project.\n\n\nAnalytics\nAs a data enthusiast, you’ll likely enjoy collecting some data about page views and visitors to your site. You might be tempted to use Google Analytics to do this; indeed quarto makes it very easy to just add a line to your _quarto.yml file to set it up. Unfortunately, in this case, going with the easy and free solution means supporting Google’s dubious corporate surveillance activities. Be a conscientious internet citizen and avoid using Google Analytics on your blog. Fortunately, there are numerous privacy-friendly alternatives to Google Analytics. For this blog I’m self-hosting umami analytics, which might warrant its own post in the future."

    "text": "More humbly suggested best practices\n\nUsing conda environments for reproducibility\nAs you know, it’s a good practice to use an environment manager to keep track of packages, their versions, and other dependencies for software in a data science project. The same applies to blog posts; especially if you’re using unusual or bleeding-edge packages in a post. This will help us out a lot when we have to go back and re-run a notebook a couple years later to regenerate the output. Here we’ll use conda as our environment manager.\nTo be clear, I don’t bother doing this if I’m just using fairly stable functionality in standard packages like pandas, numpy, and matplotlib, but we’ll do it here for illustration. From a terminal sitting inside our post subdirectory at posts/new-post, create a new conda environment with the packages you’re using in the post.\nconda create -p ./venv jupyter numpy matplotlib\nNote the -p flag which tells conda to save the environment to ./venv in the current working directory. This will save all the installed packages here in the post directory instead of in your system-wide location for conda environments. Note also that you’ll want to avoid checking anything in the venv directory into source control, so add venv to the .gitignore file at the root of the quarto project to ignore all venv directories throughout your quarto project.\nNow whenever you work on this post, you’ll navigate to the post subdirectory with a terminal and activate the conda environment.\nconda activate ./venv\nThen you can fire up your jupyter notebook from the command line, and it will use the active conda environment.\nSince we don’t want to check the venv directory with all its installed libraries into source control, we need to create an environment.yml file from which the environment can later be reproduced. With the local conda environment active, run the following.\nconda env export --from-history &gt; environment.yml\nThe --from-history flag tells conda to skip adding a bunch of system specific stuff that will gunk up your environment yaml file and make it harder to use for cross-platform reproducibility. This environment.yml file is the only environment management artifact that you need to check into git.\nLater if you need to recreate the environment from the environment.yml file, you can use the following command.\nconda env create -f environment.yml -p ./venv`\n\n\nImage file best practices\nLet’s talk about image file sizes. The key idea is that we want images to have just enough resolution to look good; any more than that and we’re just draging around larger-than-necessary files and wasting bandwidth and slowing down page load times.\nYou can read all about choosing optimal image sizes, but the TLDR is that images should be just large enough (in pixels) to fill the containers they occupy on the page. In our quarto blog, the two most common kinds of images are inline images we put in the body of posts and image thumbnails that show up as the associated image for a post, e.g. in the listing on our homepage. The inline image container seems to be about 800 pixels wide in my browser and the thumbnails are smaller, so adding some margin of error, I decided to go for 1000x750 for inline images and 500x375 for the thumbnails.\nI use a command line tool called Image Magick to resize image files. Go ahead and install image magick with homebrew, and let’s add some images to our new post.\nFor this example I’ll use a nice shot of the London Underground from Wikipedia. Save your image as image.jpg. Then use image magick to create two new resized images for inline and thumbnail use.\nconvert image.jpg -resize 1000x1000 main.jpg \nconvert image.jpg -resize 500x500 thumbnail.jpg \nThese commands do not change the aspect ratio of the image; they just reduce the size so that the image fits within the size specified.\nNow move both of your new images into the post subdirectory at posts/new-post/. To specify the thumbnail image, set the image key in the post’s front matter. Be sure to also add an alt tag description of the image using the image-alt key to keep it accessible for screen reader users. Our post’s frontmatter now looks like this.\n---\ntitle: New Post\ndate: 2023-07-12\ndescription: A nice new post\ncategories: [nonsense, code]\nimage: thumbnail.jpg\nimage-alt: \"A London Underground train emerging from a tunnel\"\n---\nTo include an image within the body of a post, use markdown in the post to include the image. I added a markdown cell just under the front matter containing the following.\n![A London Underground train emerging from a tunnel](main.jpg \"\")\nIn your preview browser window, you can see we have the thumbnail for our new post on the homepage listing.\n\n\n\nA screenshot of the homepage showing the new post’s thumbnail image\n\n\nAnd we also have the inline image appearing in the body of the post.\n\n\n\nA screenshot of the new post showing the image included in the body of the post\n\n\nYou can take a look at the source code for this blog to see some examples of including images in posts."

But we still haven’t explicitly addressed what puts the “gradient” in gradient boosting. It turns out that gradient boosting models are using a sort of gradient descent to minimize their loss function; according to Friedman’s classic paper, they’re doing gradient descent in “function space”. If you’re like me, and this is your first encounter with this idea, then the phrase “gradient descent in function space” is going to sound a little, ahem, mysterious. No worries, friends; we’re about to make sense of it all.\nUnderstanding the underlying mechanics of gradient boosting as a form of gradient descent will empower us to train our models with custom loss functions. This opens up many interesting possibilities including doing not only regression and classification, but also predicting quantiles, prediction intervals, and even the conditional probability distribution of the response variable."

    "section": "Generalized intuition for gradient boosting",
    "text": "Generalized intuition for gradient boosting\nIn my earlier post on [building a gradient boosting model from scratch](/gradient-boosting-machine-from-scratch, we established the intuition for how gradient boosting works in a regression problem. In this post we’re going to generalize the ideas we encountered in the regression context, so check out the earlier post if you’re not already familiar with gradient boosting for regression. In the following sections we’ll build up the intuition for gradient boosting in general terms, and then we’ll be able to state the gradient boosting algorithm in a form that can fit models to customized loss functions.\n\nThe loss function\nYou recall that we measure how well a model fits data by using a loss function that yields small values when a model fits well. “Training” essentially means finding the model that minimizes our loss function. A loss function takes the correct target values and the predicted target values, and it returns a scalar loss score. For example, in the last post on gradient descent we used a mean squared error (MSE) loss\n\\[L(\\mathbf{y}, \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}) =  \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2 \\]\nwhere we express the correct targets and predicted values as the vector arguments \\(\\mathbf{y}=[y_1,y_2,\\dots,y_n]\\) and \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}=[\\hat{y}_1,\\hat{y}_2,\\dots,\\hat{y}_n]\\) respectively.\n\n\nWhich way to nudge a prediction to get a better model\nNow, let’s say we have a model \\(F(\\mathbf{X})=\\mathbf{\\hat{y}}\\) that we want to improve. One approach is that we could figure out whether each prediction \\(\\hat{y}_i\\) needed to be higher or lower to get a better loss score. We could then nudge each prediction in the right direction, thereby decreasing our model’s loss score.\nTo figure out whether we should increase or decrease a particular prediction \\(\\hat{y}_i\\) (and by how much), we can compute the partial derivative of the loss function with respect to that prediction. Recall the partial derivative just tells us the rate of change in a function when we change one of its arguments. Since we want to make the loss \\(L(\\mathbf{y},\\mathbf{\\hat{y}})\\) decrease, we can use the negative partial derivative of the loss function with respect to a given prediction to help us choose the right nudge for that prediction.\n\\[ \\text{nudge for } \\hat{y}_i = -\\frac{\\partial L(\\mathbf{y},\\mathbf{\\hat{y}})}{\\partial \\hat{y}_i}\\]\nSometimes it can get a little intense when there are partial derivatives flying around, but it doesn’t have to be that way. Remember that in practice \\(-\\frac{\\partial L(\\mathbf{y},\\mathbf{\\hat{y}})}{\\partial \\hat{y}_i}\\) is just an expression that evaluates to a number like 2.7 or -0.5, and here it’s telling us how to nudge \\(\\hat{y}_i\\) to decrease our loss score.\nThe intuition is that if \\(\\frac{\\partial L(\\mathbf{y},\\mathbf{\\hat{y}})}{\\partial \\hat{y}_i}\\) is negative, then increasing the prediction \\(\\hat{y}_i\\) will make the loss decrease. We then notice that the negative of the partial derivative tells us whether to increase or decrease \\(\\hat{y}_i\\). For example, if \\(-\\frac{\\partial L(\\mathbf{y},\\mathbf{\\hat{y}})}{\\partial \\hat{y}_i}\\) is positive, then increasing the prediction \\(\\hat{y}_i\\) will make the loss decrease; whereas if \\(-\\frac{\\partial L(\\mathbf{y},\\mathbf{\\hat{y}})}{\\partial \\hat{y}_i}\\) is negative, then decreasing the prediction \\(\\hat{y}_i\\) will make the loss decrease.\nSince we’ll want to find the right nudge for each of the \\(\\hat{y}_i\\)’s, we can use the negative gradient of the loss function \\(L(\\mathbf{y},\\mathbf{\\hat{y}})\\) with respect to the vector argument \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\\) to get the vector of all the partial derivatives. Let’s call this vector of desired nudge values \\(\\mathbf{r}\\).\n\\[\\mathbf{r} = -\\nabla_{\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}} L(\\mathbf{y}, \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}) = \\left [ -\\frac{\\partial L(\\mathbf{y},\\mathbf{\\hat{y}})}{\\partial \\hat{y}_1}, -\\frac{\\partial L(\\mathbf{y},\\mathbf{\\hat{y}})}{\\partial \\hat{y}_2}, \\cdots, -\\frac{\\partial L(\\mathbf{y},\\mathbf{\\hat{y}})}{\\partial \\hat{y}_n}\\right ]\\]\n\n\nNudging predictions in the right direction\nGreat, now that we know we should nudge each prediction in the direction of the negative partial derivative of the loss with respect to that prediction, we need to figure out how to do the actual nudging. Remember that we already have an initial model \\(F(\\mathbf{X})=\\mathbf{\\hat{y}}\\).\nAt this point we might be tempted to simply add the vector of nudge values to our predictions to get better predictions.\n\\[\\text{we might be tempted to try } \\mathbf{\\hat{y}}_{\\text{new}} = \\mathbf{\\hat{y}} + \\mathbf{r}\\]\nSure, based on our reasoning in the previous section, plugging the vector of nudged predictions into the loss function would yield a lower loss score.\n\\[ L(\\mathbf{y},\\mathbf{\\hat{y}} + \\mathbf{r}) \\le L(\\mathbf{y},\\mathbf{\\hat{y}})\\]\nThe problem is that this will only work for in-sample data, because we only know the nudge values for the cases which are present in the training dataset. In order for our model to generalize to unseen test data, we need a way to get the nudge values for new observations of the independent variables. So how can we do that?\nWell what if we fit another model \\(h(\\mathbf{X})\\) that used our same features \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) to predict our desired nudge values \\(\\mathbf{r}\\), and then we added that new model to our original model \\(F(\\mathbf{X})\\). For a given prediction the nudge model \\(h(\\mathbf{X})\\) would essentially return an approximation of the desired nudge, so adding it would push the prediction in the right direction to decrease the loss function. Furthermore, the nudge model can return predictions of the nudges for out-of-sample cases which are not present in the training dataset. Since both the initial model \\(F(\\mathbf{X})\\) and the nudge model \\(h(\\mathbf{X})\\) are functions of our features \\(\\mathbf{X}\\), we can add the two functions to get an updated model that can generalize beyond the training data.\n\\[F_{\\text{new}} (\\mathbf{X}) = F(\\mathbf{X}) + h(\\mathbf{X})\\]"

    "text": "Gradient boosting is gradient descent in function space, a.k.a. prediction space\nLet’s address the statement in Friedman’s classic paper that gradient boosting is doing gradient descent in function space. Again we’ll use parameter gradient descent as a basis for comparison.\nIn parameter gradient descent, we have a vector of parameter values which, when plugged into the loss function, return some loss score. At each step of gradient descent, we compute the negative gradient of the loss function with respect to each parameter; that tells us which way to nudge each parameter value to achieve a lower loss score. We then add this vector of parameter nudge values to our previous parameter vector to get the new parameter vector. We could view this sequence of successive parameter vectors as a trajectory passing through parameter space, the space spanned by all possible parameter values. Therefore parameter gradient descent operates in parameter space.\nIn contrast, when we do gradient boosting, at each step we have a model, a.k.a. a function, that maps feature values to predictions. Given our training dataset, this model yields predictions which can be plugged into our loss function to get a loss score. At each boosting iteration, we compute the negative gradient of the loss with respect to each of the predictions; that tells us which way to nudge each prediction to achieve a lower loss score. We then create a function (a crappy model) that takes feature values and returns an approximation of the corresponding prediction’s nudge value. We then add this crappy model (a function) to our current composite model (also a function) to get the new composite model (you guessed it; also a function). And so by analogy with parameter vectors in parameter space, we can view this sequence of successive model functions as a trajectory passing through function space, the space spanned by all possible functions that map feature values to predictions. Therefore, gradient boosting does gradient descent in function space.\nIf this talk about function space still feels a little abstract, you could just use the same substitution trick we used above and swap the model \\(F(\\mathbf{X})\\) for its predictions \\(\\mathbf{\\hat{y}}\\) which is just a vector of numbers. The target values for our nudge models are given by the negative gradient of the loss with respect to this prediction vector. From here, we can see that each time we add a new nudge model to our composite model, we get a new prediction vector. We can view this sequence of successive prediction vectors as a trajectory passing through prediction space, the space spanned by all possible prediction vector values. Therefore we can also say that gradient boosting does gradient descent in prediction space."

    "section": "So why did we fit the crappy models to the residuals in our regression GBM?",
    "text": "So why did we fit the crappy models to the residuals in our regression GBM?\nIn my first post on [gradient boosting machines](/gradient-boosting-machine-from-scratch, in the interest of simplicity I left one key aspect of the problem unaddressed, that is, what loss function were we using to train that GBM? It turns out that because of the way we built our GBM, without knowing it we were actually using a mean squared error (MSE) loss function.\n\\[L(\\mathbf{y}, \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}) =  \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2 \\]\nIf the GBM was using gradient descent to find a \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\\) vector that minimized this loss function, then at each iteration it would have to nudge the current \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\\) by the negative gradient of the loss function with respect to \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\\), i.e. \\(-\\nabla_{\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}} L(\\mathbf{y}, \\hat{\\mathbf{y}})\\). Since our loss function takes a length \\(n\\) vector of predictions \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\\) as input, the gradient will be a length-\\(n\\) vector of partial derivatives with respect to each of the predictions \\(\\hat{y}_i\\). Let’s start by taking the negative partial derivative with respect to a particular prediction \\(\\hat{y}_j\\).\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\hat{y}_j} L(\\mathbf{y}, \\mathbf{\\hat{y}})\n    & = & -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\hat{y}_j} \\left ( \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2 \\right ) \\\\\n    & = & -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\hat{y}_j} \\left ( \\frac{1}{n} (y_j - \\hat{y}_j)^2 \\right ) \\\\\n    & = & -\\frac{1}{n} (2)(y_j - \\hat{y}_j) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\hat{y}_j} (y_j - \\hat{y}_j) \\\\\n    & = & \\frac{2}{n} (y_j - \\hat{y}_j) \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nIt turns out that the negative partial derivative of the MSE loss function with respect to a particular prediction \\(\\hat{y}_i\\) is proportional to the residual \\(y_i - \\hat{y}_i\\)! This is a pretty intuitive result, because if we nudge a prediction by it’s residual, we’ll end up with the correct target value.\nWe can go ahead and write the nudge vector as\n\\[\\mathbf{r} = -\\nabla_{\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}} L(\\mathbf{y}, \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}) = \\frac{2}{n}(\\mathbf{y} - \\hat{\\mathbf{y}})\\]\nwhich is proportional to the residual vector \\(\\mathbf{y} - \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\\). This means that when we use the mean squared error loss function, our nudge values are given by the current model residuals, and therefore each new crappy model targets the previous model’s residuals.\nAnd this result brings us full circle, back to our original intuition from the first GBM post about chasing residuals with crappy models. Now we see that intuitive idea is just a special case of the more general and, dare I say, even more beautiful idea of chasing the negative gradient of the loss function with crappy models."

These tree ensemble methods perform very well on tabular data prediction problems and are therefore widely used in industrial applications and machine learning competitions.\nThere are several noteworthy variants of gradient boosting out there in the wild including XGBoost, NGBoost, LightGBM, and of course the classic gradient boosting machine (GBM). While XGBoost and LightGBM tend to have a marginal performance edge on the classic GBM, they are all based on a similar, very clever, idea about how to ensemble decision trees.

Our GBM fits that nonlinear data pretty well.\nNow that we have a working implementation, let’s go ahead and implement it as a class with fit and predict methods like we’re used to having in sklearn.\n\nclass GradientBoostingFromScratch():\n    \n    def __init__(self, n_trees, learning_rate, max_depth=1):\n        self.n_trees=n_trees; self.learning_rate=learning_rate; self.max_depth=max_depth;\n        \n    def fit(self, x, y):\n        self.trees = []\n        self.F0 = y.mean()\n        Fm = self.F0 \n        for _ in range(self.n_trees):\n            tree = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=self.max_depth)\n            tree.fit(x, y - Fm)\n            Fm += self.learning_rate * tree.predict(x)\n            self.trees.append(tree)\n            \n    def predict(self, x):\n        return self.F0 + self.learning_rate * np.sum([tree.predict(x) for tree in self.trees], axis=0)\n\nLet’s compare the performance of our implementation with the sklearn GradientBoostingRegressor.\n\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error\n\nsklearn_gbm = GradientBoostingRegressor(n_estimators =25, learning_rate=0.3, max_depth=1)\nsklearn_gbm.fit(x,y)\n\nscratch_gbm = GradientBoostingFromScratch(n_trees=25, learning_rate=0.3, max_depth=1)\nscratch_gbm.fit(x,y)\n\nmean_squared_error(y, sklearn_gbm.predict(x)), mean_squared_error(y, scratch_gbm.predict(x))\n\n(0.08622324648703916, 0.0862232464870392)\n\n\nHeck yeah! Our homemade GBM is consistent with the sklearn implementation!"

    "text": "Wrapping Up\nAlright, there you have it, the intuition behind basic gradient boosting and a from scratch implementation of the gradient boosting machine. I tried to keep this explanation as simple as possible while giving a complete intuition for the basic GBM. But it turns out that the rabbit hole goes pretty deep on these gradient boosting algorithms. We can actually wave our magic generalization wand over some custom loss functions and end up with algorithms that can do gradient descent in function space (whatever that means). We’ll get into what that means and why it’s so baller in future posts. For now, go forth and boost!"

I hope you find the content useful, and I hope you enjoy reading along and learning with me!\nAnd me? Well, I’m Matt Bowers. I’m an ex data scientist at Uber where I solved problems using statistical modeling and machine learning. Over the years I’ve driven product decisions through controlled experimentation and user analytics, built ML products like ETA prediction on large-scale telematics data, and cracked long-standing ML problems in marketplace pricing. Before Uber I earned an MS in Applied Statistics and a PhD in Atmospheric Sciences at Purdue University where I studied the spatial-temporal correlation structure of tropical convection systems and developed statistical methods for climate research.\nBut enough about me. Let’s get down with some data science!"
