    "Well, dear reader, it's that time again, time for us to do a seemingly unnecessary scratch build of a popular algorithm that most people would simply import from the library without a second thought. But readers of this blog are not most people.  Of course you know that when we do scratch builds, it's not for the hell of it, it's for the purpose of demystification. To that end, today we are going to implement XGBoost from scratch in python, using only numpy and pandas. \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically we're going to implement the core statistical learning algorithm of XGBoost, including most of the key hyperparameters and their functionality. Our implementation will also support user-defined custom objective functions, meaning that it can perform regression, classification, and whatever exotic learning tasks you can dream up, as long as you can write down a twice-differentiable objective function. We'll refrain from implementing some simple features like column subsampling which will be left to you, gentle reader, as exercises. In terms of tree methods, we're going to implement the exact tree-splitting algorithm, leaving the sparsity-aware method (used to handle missing feature values) and the approximate method (used for scalability) as exercises or maybe topics for future posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "As always, if something is unclear, try backtracking through the previous posts on gradient boosting and decision trees to clarify your intuition. We've already built up all the statistical and computational background needed to make sense of this scratch build. Here are the most important prerequisite posts:\n",

I've also added row subsampling by drawing a random subset of instance indices and passing them to the tree booster during each boosting round. The rest of the fit method is the same as the classic GBM, and the predict method is identical too."

    "The XGBoost tree booster is a modified version of the decision tree that we built in the decision tree from scratch post. Like the decision tree, we recursively build a binary tree structure by finding the best split rule for each node in the tree. The main difference is the criterion for evaluating splits and the way that we define a leaf's predicted value. Instead of being functions of the target values of the instances in each node, the criterion and predicted values are functions of the instance gradients and hessians. Thus we need only make a couple of modifications to our previous decision tree implementation to create the XGBoost tree booster.\n",

    "Most of the init method is just parsing the parameter dictionary to assign parameters as object attributes. The one notable difference from our decision tree is in the way we define the node's predicted value. We define `self.value` according to equation 5 of the XGBoost paper, a simple function of the gradient and hessian values of the instances in the current node. Of course the init also goes on to build the tree via the maybe insert child nodes method. This method is nearly identical to the one we implemented for our decision tree. So far so good."

We've been hammering away at the various concepts around gradient boosting, leaving a trail of equations and scratch-built algos in our wake. Today we put all of that together to create a legit scratch build of XGBoost, something that would have been out of reach for me before we embarked on this journey together over a year ago. To anyone with the patience to read through this stuff, cheers to you! I hope you're learning and enjoying this as much as I am. \n",
