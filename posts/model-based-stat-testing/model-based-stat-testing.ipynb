    "Howdy, dear reader; Today we're going to explore a powerful, unifying perspective that we can apply to many classical statistical tests.\n",
    "Indeed, there are [lots of statistical tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Statistical_tests)\n",
    "out there, each with its own purpose and assumptions.\n",
    "You can find fun flowcharts like the one below to help you navigate this zoo of procedures.\n",
    "But it doesn't have to be that way\n",
    "\n",
    "*It turns out that many traditional frequentist tests can be viewed as special cases of regression models.*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a powerful and liberating idea, because it can help us transition from choosing from the zoo of canned methods to building our own bespoke analyses, tailored to our exact use case.\n",
    "Adopting this perspective will allow us to\n",
    "\n",
    "- anchor on the data generating process\n",
    "- make our assumptions clear and explicit up front\n",
    "- easily reformulate traditional frequentist procedures in a Bayesian framework\n",
    "\n",
    "So the plan for this post is to take a look at a few of the most common statistical tests, and formulate each one as a regression model. We'll implement each one using its dedicated stats library method and also a generic regression model.\n",
