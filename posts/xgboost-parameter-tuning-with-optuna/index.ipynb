    "Ahh, the dark art of hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "It's a key step in the machine learning workflow,\n",

    "Therefore, dear reader, it is an art that requires the application of both skill and wisdom to realize its full potential while avoiding its perils.\n",
    "Today I'll show you my approach for hyperparameter tuning XGBoost, although the principles apply to any GBT framework.\n",
    "I'll give you some intuition for how to think about the key parameters in XGBoost,\n",
    "and I'll show you an efficient strategy for parameter tuning GBTs.\n",
    "I'll be using the optuna python library to tune parameters with bayesian optimization, but you can implement my strategy with whatever hyperparameter tuning utility you like.\n",
    "You can download a notebook with this tuning workflow from my [data science templates repository](https://github.com/mcb00/ds-templates).\n",
    "Finally we'll wrap up with the kind of cautionary tale data scientists tell their colleagues around the campfire about when all this fancy hyperparameter tuning can backfire catastrophically&mdash;ignore at your own peril."

    "## XGBoost Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient boosting algorithms like XGBoost have two main types of hyperparameters: *tree parameters* which control the decision tree trained at each boosting round and *boosting parameters* which control the boosting procedure itself.\n",
    "Below I'll highlight my favorite parameters, but you can see the full list in the [documentation](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/parameter.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tree Parameters\n",
    "In theory you can use any kind of model as a base learner in a gradient boosting algorithm, but for reasons we discussed before, [decision trees](/posts/consider-the-decision-tree/) \n",
    "are typically the best choice.\n",
    "In XGBoost, we can choose the tree construction algorithm, and we get three types of parameters to control its behavior: tree complexity parameters, sampling parameters, and regularization parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tree construction algorithm\n",
    "The tree construction algorithm boils down to split finding, and\n",
    "different algorithms have different ways of generating candidate splits to consider.\n",
    "In XGBoost we have the parameter:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `tree_method` - select tree construction algorithm: `exact`, `hist`,  `approx`, or the horrifying default&mdash;`auto`&mdash;which outsources your choice of tree construction algo to XGBoost and which you should never ever use.  I've been burned by this hidden `tree_method=auto` default multiple times before learning my lesson. Why is the online model worse than the offline model? Why is this model suddenly taking so much longer to train? Avoid these debugging nightmares and set `tree_method` explicitly; the exact method tends to be slow and ironically less accurate, so I use either approx or hist.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tree complexity parameters\n",
    "Tree complexity just means how many leaf nodes the trees have, and therefore how expressive they can be.\n",
    "I use these two parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `max_depth` - maximum number of split levels allowed. Reasonable values are usually from 3-12.\n",
    "* `min_child_weight` - minimum allowable sum of hessian values over data in a node. When using the default squared error objective, this is the minimum number of samples allowed in a leaf node (see [this explanation](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/317073/explanation-of-min-child-weight-in-xgboost-algorithm) of why that's true).\n",
    "For a squared error objective, values in [1, 200] usually work well.\n",
    "\n",
    "These two parameters oppose each other; increasing max depth allows for more expressive trees, while increasing  min child weight makes trees less expressive and therefore is a powerful way to counter overfitting.\n",
    "Note that `gamma` (a.k.a. `min_split_loss`) also limits node splitting, but I usually don't use it because `min_child_weight` seems to work well enough on its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sampling parameters\n",
    "XGBoost can randomly sample rows and columns to be used for training each tree;\n",
    "you might think of this as *bagging*.\n",
    "We have a few parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `subsample` - proportion of rows to use in each tree. Setting this less than 1.0 results in stochastic gradient descent, because each tree is trained on only a subset of the entire training dataset. Any value in (0,1] is valid, but it seems like values in [0.7, 1] are usually the best.\n",
    "* `colsample_bytree`, `colsample_bylevel`, `colsample_bynode` - control the fraction of columns available to each tree, at each split level, or at each split, respectively. I usually use either by level or by node because I like the idea that trees might be forced to learn interactions by having different features available at each subsequent split.  Again, values in (0,1] are valid, but values in [0.5,1] usually seem to work best.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Regularization parameters\n",
    "In XGBoost, regularization penalizes the actual values predicted by the individual trees, pushing values toward zero.\n",
    "I usually use:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `reg_lambda` - L2 regularization  of tree predicted values. Increasing this parameter decreases tree expressiveness and therefore counters overfitting. \n",
    "Valid values are in [0,$\\infty$), but good values typically fall in [0,10].\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also an L1 regularization parameter called `reg_alpha`; feel free to use it instead.\n",
    "It seems that using one or the other is usually sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Boosting Parameters and Early Stopping\n",
    "Trained gradient boosting models take the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F(\\mathbf{x}) = b + \\eta \\sum_{k=1}^{K} f_k(\\mathbf{x}) $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where $b$ is the constant base predicted value, $f_k(\\cdot)$ is the base learner for round $k$, parameter $K$ is the number of boosting rounds, and parameter $\\eta$ is the learning rate.\n",
    "In XGBoost these parameters correspond with:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `num_boost_round` ($K$) - the number of boosting iterations\n",
    "* `learning_rate` ($\\eta$) - the scaling or \"shrinkage\" factor applied to the predicted value of each base learner. Valid values are in (0,1]; the default is 0.3. Fun fact: the $\\eta$ character is called \"eta\", and `learning_rate` is aliased to `eta` in xgboost, so you can use parameter `eta` instead of `learning_rate` if you like.\n",
    "\n",
    "These two parameters are very closely linked; the optimal value of one depends on the value of the other.\n",
    "To illustrate their relationship, we can train two different XGBoost models on the same training dataset, where one model has a lower learning rate than the other."

    "The above figure shows root mean squared error measured on a held-out validation dataset for two different XGBoost models: one with a higher learning rate and one with a lower learning rate.\n",
    "The figure demonstrates two key properties of the boosting parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. While training a model with a given learning rate, the evaluation score (computed on a hold-out set) tends to improve with additional boosting rounds up to a certain point, but beyond that point it flattens out or even gets worse.\n",
    "1. All else constant, a smaller learning rate leads to a model with more boosting rounds and better  evaluation score.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can leverage the first property to make our tuning more efficient by using XGBoost's `early_stopping_rounds: int` argument, which terminates training after observing the specified number of boosting rounds [without sufficient improvement](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/pull/6942)\n",
    "to the evaluation metric.\n",
    "The models above were trained using `early_stopping_rounds=50`, which terminates training after 50 boosting rounds without improvement in RMSE on the validation data.\n",
    "For each model, the arrow indicates the boosting round with the best score.\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure also exemplifies the second property, where the model with lower learning rate attains a better validation score but requires more boosting rounds to trigger early stopping.\n",
    "Note that smaller and smaller learning rates will provide diminishing improvements to the validation score."

    "## An Efficient Parameter Search Strategy for XGBoost\n",
    "Efficiency is the key to effective parameter tuning, because wasting less time means searching more  parameter values and finding better models in a given amount of time.\n",
    "But as we just saw, there is a tradeoff between accuracy and training time via the learning rate.\n",
    "Given infinite time and compute resources, we would just choose an arbitrarily tiny learning rate and search through tree parameter values while using early stopping to choose the number of boosting rounds.\n",
    "The problem is that tiny learning rates require tons of boosting rounds, which will make our ideal search prohibitively slow when confronted with the reality of finite time and resources.\n",
    "So what can we do?\n",
    "\n",
    "My approach is based on the claim that\n",
    "*good tree parameters at one learning rate are also good tree parameters at other learning rates*.\n",
    "The intuition is that given two models&mdash;one with good tree parameters and one with bad tree parameters&mdash;the model with good tree parameters will score better, regardless of the learning rate.\n",
    "Thus, tree parameters are \"independent\" of boosting parameters&mdash;See \n",
    "[this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1feyrtDphFizVI1VmctrNgpJzonsmWiHx?usp=sharing) for justification of this claim.\n",
    "\n",
    "Independence between tree parameters and boosting parameters suggests a two-stage procedure where we first find optimal tree parameters, then we maximize performance by pushing boosting parameters to the extreme.\n",
    "The procedure is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tune tree parameters.** Fix the learning rate at a relatively high value (like 0.3ish) and enable early stopping so that each model trains within a few seconds. Use your favorite hyperparameter tuning technique to find the optimal tree parameters.\n",
    "1. **Tune boosting parameters.** Using these optimal tree parameter values, fix the learning rate as low as you want and train your model, using early stopping to identify the optimal number of boosting rounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this a good idea? \n",
    "Because by starting with a high learning rate and early stopping enabled, you can burn through hundreds of model training trials and find some really good tree parameters in a few minutes.\n",
    "Then, with the confidence that your tree parameters are actually quite good,  you can set a really low learning rate and boost a few thousand rounds to get a model with the best of both tree parameter and boosting parameter worlds.\n",
    "\n",
    "> You can check out [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1feyrtDphFizVI1VmctrNgpJzonsmWiHx?usp=sharing)\n",
    "where I justify this approach by running two parameter searches&mdash;one with high learning rate and one with low learning rate&mdash;showing that they recover the same optimal tree parameters."

    "## Tuning XGBoost Parameters with Optuna\n",
    "\n",
    "[Optuna](https://optuna.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)\n",
    "is a model-agnostic python library for hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "I like it because it has a flexible API that abstracts away the details of the search algorithm being used.\n",
    "That means you can use this one library to tune all kinds of different models, and you can easily switch the parameter sampling approach among grid search, random search, the very sensible default bayesian optimization, and more.\n",
    "Another massive benefit is that optuna provides a specific [XGBoost integration](https://optuna.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/generated/optuna.integration.XGBoostPruningCallback.html) \n",
    "which terminates training early on lousy parameter combinations.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Hyperparameter tuning can easily be overlooked in the move-fast-and-break-everything hustle of building an ML product, but it can also easily become overkill or even downright harmful, depending on the application.\n",
    "There are three key questions to ask:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How much value is created by an incremental gain in model prediction accuracy?\n",
    "1. What is the cost of increasing model prediction accuracy?\n",
    "1. Is my model answering the right question?\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes a small gain in model prediction performance translates into millions of dollars of impact.\n",
    "The dream scenario is that you swoop in on some key model in your organization, markedly improve its accuracy with an easy afternoon of hyperparameter tuning, realize massive improvements in your org's KPIs, and get mad respect, bonuses, and promoted.\n",
    "But the reality is that often additional model accuracy doesn't really change business KPIs by very much.\n",
    "Try to figure out the actual value of improved model accuracy and proceed accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember too that hyperparameter tuning has its costs, most obviously the developer time and compute resources for the search itself.\n",
    "It can also lead us to larger and deeper models which take longer to train, occupy larger memory footprints, and have higher prediction latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Worst of all and quite counterintuitively, it's possible that improving a model's prediction accuracy can compromise overall business KPIs.\n",
    "I've seen this with my own eyes at work;\n",
    "offline testing shows that hyperparameter tuning significantly improves a model's prediction accuracy, but when the model goes into production, an AB test shows that the business KPIs are actually worse.\n",
    "What happened?\n",
    "In this case, the model's prediction was being used indirectly to infer the relationship between one of the features and the prediction target to inform automatic business decisions.\n",
    "Answering questions about how changing an input will affect an output requires causal reasoning, and [traditional ML models are not the right tool for the job](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00060).\n",
    "I'll have a lot more to say about that soon;\n",
    "let this story foreshadow an epic new epoch on Random Realizations...."
