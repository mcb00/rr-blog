One approach is that we could figure out whether each prediction $\\hat{y}_i$ needed to be higher or lower to get a better loss score. We could then nudge each prediction in the right direction, thereby decreasing our model's loss score.\n",
    "\n",
    "To figure out whether we should increase or decrease a particular prediction $\\hat{y}_i$ (and by how much), we can compute the partial derivative of the loss function with respect to that prediction. Recall the partial derivative just tells us the rate of change in a function when we change one of its arguments. Since we want to make the loss $L(\\mathbf{y},\\mathbf{\\hat{y}})$ decrease, we can use the negative partial derivative of the loss function with respect to a given prediction to help us choose the right nudge for that prediction.\n",

    "The intuition is that if  $\\frac{\\partial L(\\mathbf{y},\\mathbf{\\hat{y}})}{\\partial \\hat{y}_i}$ is negative, then increasing the prediction $\\hat{y}_i$ will make the loss decrease. We then notice that the negative of the partial derivative tells us whether to increase or decrease $\\hat{y}_i$. For example, if $-\\frac{\\partial L(\\mathbf{y},\\mathbf{\\hat{y}})}{\\partial \\hat{y}_i}$ is positive, then *increasing* the prediction $\\hat{y}_i$ will make the loss decrease; whereas if  $-\\frac{\\partial L(\\mathbf{y},\\mathbf{\\hat{y}})}{\\partial \\hat{y}_i}$ is negative, then *decreasing* the prediction $\\hat{y}_i$ will make the loss decrease.\n",

We then add this vector of parameter nudge values to our previous parameter vector to get the new parameter vector. We could view this sequence of successive parameter vectors as a trajectory passing through *parameter space*, the space spanned by all possible parameter values.

We then add this crappy model (a function) to our current composite model (also a function) to get the new composite model (you guessed it; also a function).

From here, we can see that each time we add a new nudge model to our composite model, we get a new prediction vector.
