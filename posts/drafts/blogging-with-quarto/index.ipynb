    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "https://example.com/posts/welcome/index.html\n",

    "\n",
    "but the browser knows if you give it a URL with a path ending in a `/`, then it should look for the `index.html` file inside that directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I think the best practice here is to name your new post subdirectory with the title of the post in all lower case with dashes for spaces, e.g. `post-with-code`.\n",
    "Then to force all output pages to be called `index.html`, you can set the `output-file` key in the `posts/_metadata.yml`\n",

    "Note that paths need to start with the `/` at the root of the quarto project, since without it, quarto will try to resolve paths relative to the location of the current document instead of the root of the project.\n",

    "Quarto allows you to specify numerous [code execution options](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html),\n",
    " designated by the `# |` prefix,  to control the behavior and appearance of the code and output at a cell level.\n",
    "I set two keys here, `fig-cap` and `fig-alt` which respectively set the figure caption text and the image alt tag text.\n",
    "The `fig-alt` key is particularly important to set on all your figures because it provides the non-visual description for screenreader users reading your post.\n",
    "The alt tag should be a simple description of what the plot is and possibly what it shows or means.\n",
    "Be a friend of the blind and visually impaired community and set `fig-alt` on all of your figures.\n",

    "### Using conda environments for reproducibility\n",
    "\n",
    "As you know, it's a good practice to use an environment manager to keep track of packages, their versions, and other dependencies for software in a data science project.\n",
    "The same applies to blog posts; especially if you're using unusual or bleeding-edge packages in a post.\n",
    "This will help us out a lot when we have to go back and re-run a notebook a couple years later to regenerate the output.\n",
    "Here we'll use [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html) as our environment manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be clear, I don't bother doing this if I'm just using fairly stable functionality in standard packages like pandas, numpy, and matplotlib, but we'll do it here for illustration.\n",
    "From a terminal sitting inside our post subdirectory at `posts/new-post`, \n",
    "create a new conda environment with the packages you're using in the post.\n",
    "\n",
    "```zsh\n",
    "conda create -p ./venv jupyter numpy matplotlib\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the `-p` flag which tells conda to save the environment to `./venv` in the current working directory.\n",
    "This will save all the installed packages here in the post directory instead of in your system-wide location for conda environments.\n",
    "Note also that you'll want to avoid checking anything in the `venv` directory into source control, so add `venv` to the `.gitignore` file at the root of the quarto project to ignore all `venv` directories throughout your quarto project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now whenever you work on this post, you'll navigate to the post subdirectory with a terminal and activate the conda environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "```zsh\n",
    "conda activate ./venv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you can fire up your jupyter notebook from the command line, and it will use the active conda environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we don't want to check the `venv` directory with all its installed libraries into source control,\n",
    "we need to create an `environment.yml` file from which the environment can later be reproduced.\n",
    "With the local conda environment active, run the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "```zsh\n",
    "conda env export --from-history > environment.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `--from-history` flag tells conda to skip adding a bunch of system specific stuff that will gunk up your environment yaml file and make it harder to use for cross-platform reproducibility.\n",
    "This `environment.yml` file is the only environment management artifact that you need to check into git.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later if you need to recreate the environment from the `environment.yml` file, you can use the following command.\n",

    "### Image file best practices\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's talk about image file sizes.\n",
    "The key idea is that we want images to have just enough resolution to look good; any more than that and we're just draging around larger-than-necessary files and wasting bandwidth and slowing down page load times.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read all about [choosing optimal image sizes](https://www.foregroundweb.com/image-size/),\n",
    "but the TLDR is that images should be just large enough (in pixels) to fill the containers they occupy on the page.\n",
    "In our quarto blog, the two most common kinds of images are inline images we put in the body of posts and image thumbnails that show up as the associated image for a post, e.g. in the listing on our homepage.\n",
    "The inline image container seems to be about 800 pixels wide in my browser and the thumbnails are smaller,\n",
    "so adding some margin of error, I decided to go for 1000x750 for inline images and 500x375 for the thumbnails.\n",
    "\n",
    "I use a command line tool called [Image Magick](https://imagemagick.org) to resize image files.\n",

    "Save your image as `image.jpg`.\n",
    "Then use image magick to create two new resized images for inline and thumbnail use.\n",
    "\n",
    "```zsh\n",
    "convert image.jpg -resize 1000x1000 main.jpg \n",
    "convert image.jpg -resize 500x500 thumbnail.jpg \n",
    "```\n",

    "Now move both of your new images into the post subdirectory at `posts/new-post/`.\n",
    "To specify the thumbnail image, set the `image` key in the post's front matter.\n",
