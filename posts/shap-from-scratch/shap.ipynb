    "Ahh, SHAP. As you know it's become one of the leading frameworks for explaining ML model predictions. I'd guess it's popularity is due to its appealing theoretical basis, its universal applicability to any type of ML model, and its easy-to-use python package. SHAP promises to turn your black box ML model into a nice friendly interpretable model. The hilarious irony is that, when I first started using it in my work, SHAP itself was a complete black box to me. In this post, we'll change all that by diving into the SHAP paper, illuminating the key theoretical ideas behind its development step by step, and implementing it from scratch in python. If you aren't already familiar with how to compute and interpret SHAP values in practice, I'd recommend that you go check out the [documentation for the shap python package](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) before diving into this post.\n"

    "## What is SHAP?\n",
    "\n",
    "SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is a conceptual framework, a set of computational methods, and a python library for generating explanations of ML model predictions. The \"SHAP\" [backronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backronym) was introduced in [Lundberg and Lee 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07874), which I call the _SHAP paper_, that expanded on several previously existing ideas which we'll build up in the following sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* First, _Shapley values_, a concept from cooperative game theory which originally had nothing to do with machine learning.\n",
    "* Next, _Shapley regression values_, which showed how to use Shapley values to generate explanations of model predictions.\n",
    "* Finally, _Shapley sampling values_, which offered a computationally tractable way to compute Shapley regression values for any type of model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SHAP paper tied Shapley regression values and several other existing model explanation methods together by showing they are all members of a class called \"additive feature attribution methods.\" Under the right conditions, these additive feature attribution methods can generate Shapley values, and when they do we can call them SHAP values.\n",
    "\n",
    "After establishing this theoretical framework, the authors go on to discuss various computational methods for computing SHAP values; some are model-agnostic, meaning they work with any type of model, and others are model-specific, meaning they work for specific types of models. It turns out that  the previously existing Shapley sampling values method is a model-agnostic approach, but while it's the most intuitive, computationally speaking it's relatively inefficient.\n",
    "Thus the authors propose a novel model-agnostic approach called Kernel SHAP, which is really just [LIME](https://lime-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) parameterized to yield SHAP values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model-specific approaches can be potentially much more efficient than model-agnostic ones by taking advantage of model idiosyncrasies.\n",
    "For example, there is an analytical solution for the SHAP values of linear models, so Linear SHAP is extremely efficient.\n",
    "Similarly, Deep SHAP and Tree SHAP (proposed later in  [Lundberg et al 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666827022000500#b20)) take advantage of idiosyncrasies of deep learning and tree-based models to compute SHAP values efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "The important thing about these different methods is that they provide computationally tractable ways to compute SHAP values, but ultimately, they are all based on the original method—Shapley sampling values. Thus, for the remainder of this post, we'll focus on this method, building it up from Shapley values to Shapley regression values to Shapley sampling values and ultimately implementing it from scratch in python.\n"

    "## Shapley Values\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Shapley value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapley_value) is named in honor of Nobel prize winning economist Loyd Shapley who introduced the idea in the field of coalitional game theory in the 1950's. Shapley proposed a way to determine how a coalition of players can fairly share the payout they receive from a cooperative game. We'll introduce the mathematical formalism in the next section, so for now let's just touch on the intuition for the approach.  Essentially, the method distributes the payout among the players according to the expected contribution of each player across all possible combinations of the players. The thought experiment works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Draw a random permutation (ordering) of the players.\n",
    "2. Have the first player play alone, generating some payout. Then have the first two players play together, generating some payout. Then the first three, and so on.\n",
    "3. As each new player is added, attribute the change in the payout to this new player.\n",
    "4. Repeat this experiment for all permutations of the players. A player's Shapley value is the average change in payout (across all permutations) when that player is added to the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we'll see how this idea can be applied to model explanations.\n"

In ML models, the order of features doesn't matter, so we can work with unordered subsets of features, scaling the prediction difference terms by the number of permutations that involve the same sets of included and excluded features.  With that in mind, we can see the factor gives us a weighted average over all feature combinations, where the numerator gives the number of permutations in which the included features come first, followed by the feature of interest, followed by the excluded features, and the denominator is the total number of feature permutations.\n",

    "Next, [Štrumbelj and Kononenko 2014](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10115-013-0679-x) proposed _Shapley sampling values_,  a method which provides a much more efficient way to approximate the subset models used to calculate Shapley regression values. In this approach, the effect of removing some features from the model is approximated by the conditional expectation of the model given the known features.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f_S(x_S)  := E[f(x) | x_S]  $$ \n",

    "This means we're approximating the output of a subset model by averaging over outputs of the full model. That's great because now we don't have to train all those new subset models, we can just query our full model over some set of inputs and average over the outputs to compute these conditional expectation subset models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now how exactly do we compute that conditional expectation? First we rewrite the above conditional expectation (equation 10 in the SHAP paper)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ E[f(x) | x_S]  = E_{x_{\\bar{S}}|x_S} [f(x)]$$ \n",

    "Beside this equation in the paper they give the note \"expectation over $x_{\\bar{S}} | x_S$,  which means we're taking the expectation over the missing features given the known features.\n",

    "The intuition here is that if the missing features are correlated with the known features, then their distribution depends on the particular values taken by the known features. But here the authors make the simplifying assumption that known and missing features are independent, which allows us to replace the conditional expectation with an unconditional expectation over the missing features.\n",

    ":::{.callout-note}\n",
    "Is that a problem?  🤷‍♀️ Uh, maybe. Problem enough that people have worked out some ways to relax this assumption, e.g. [partition masking](https://shap-lrjball.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/shap.PartitionExplainer.html), but that makes Owen values, not Shapley values, and today we're talking about Shapley values.\n",

A good candidate is the training data we used to train our model.  Štrumbelj and Kononenko 2014 propose a way to estimate this conditional expectation using resampling of the background dataset.\n",

    "Our resampling scheme will be based on constructing Frankenstein samples $x^*=\\{x_S,z_{\\bar{S}} \\}$ where $z_{\\bar{S}}$ are values of the missing features drawn from some random observation in the background dataset.\n",
    "We can then compute an estimate $\\hat{f}_S(x)$ of the conditional expectation $E_{x_{\\bar{S}}}[f(x)]$ as\n",
