Welcome to Random Realizations!
This blog is a celebration of the fascinating world of data science.
I hope you find the content useful, and I hope you enjoy reading along and learning with me!

And me? Well, I'm Matt Bowers.
I'm an ex data scientist at Uber where I solved problems using statistical modeling and machine learning. 
Over the years I've driven product decisions through controlled experimentation and user analytics, built ML products like ETA prediction on large-scale telematics data, and cracked long-standing ML problems in marketplace pricing.
Before Uber I earned an MS in Applied Statistics and a PhD in Atmospheric Sciences at Purdue University where I studied the spatial-temporal correlation structure of tropical convection systems and developed statistical methods for climate research.

But enough about me. Let's get down with some data science!
