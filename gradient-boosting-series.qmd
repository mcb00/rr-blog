Ahh, gradient boosting.  In addition to having a totally kickass name, this family of machine learning algorithms is currently among the best known approaches for prediction problems on structured data. 
This series of posts strives to give a comprehensive understanding of gradient boosting by providing intuitive mathematical explanations, from-scratch implementations of key algorithms, and examples of how to apply modern gradient boosting libraries to solve practical data science problems.

I recommend reading through the series in order, since concepts tend to build on earlier ideas.
